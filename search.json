Each submodule topic will include corresponding Tasks- adopting a “learn by doing” approach. - Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with the learning objective(s). - It’s useful to have exercises directly after a topic is taught to reinforce what was learnt.\nFor students who advance faster: Prepare extra exercises."

Both modes work with the same file, but they provide slightly different experiences. In this lesson, most of our tasks will be done in Source mode, but you’ll also have a chance to try Visual mode so you can compare how the same content looks and feels in each."

You could choose other formats like PDF or Word, but for this lesson we’ll stick with HTML so everyone has the same experience.\nInstructor Note - There is a small clipboard icon at the top-right of the text box.

They’re marked by three backticks followed by the language name, like {r} or {python}. - These let us write and execute code, and then display the results, such as tables, plots, or calculations, right in the document. Code chunks make it possible to combine text and analysis in one place, so the document stays reproducible and dynamic. Instructor Notes - using {r} to start the Code Chunk indicates that the coding language that we’re using is R. This is relevant for this lesson as students will be using R Studio and possession pof some background knowledge in R is assumed."

For example, we can choose whether to show or hide the code itself, whether readers can fold code open and closed, or whether only the results are shown. - Currently in our YAML, we have it set to code-fold: false which means the code is displayed as in the image. - These settings don’t change the analysis, but just change how it’s displayed. This flexibility is helpful because sometimes we want to highlight the process by showing the code, and other times we want readers to focus on the results. - In open research, showing the underlying code isn’t just a technical choice, it’s important for building trust and reproducibility."

Doing this allows you as the instructor to view the pull requests made to this fork and subsequently merge them (OSC has ownership of the original repo and so any pull requests to that repo would require their approval). It is advisable to do this before the session so that on the day of the lesson, you can easily give the learners a link to access this main repository.

Scan the QR code and go to the “starting survey” question series. Please answer honestly and don’t worry about having little to no prior knowledge about Quarto. This lesson is for beginners.\nInstructor Notes: - Aim: the pre-submodule survey serves to examine learners’ prior knowledge about the submodule’s topic.  - Scanning the QR code would take them to a room on Particify with multiple question series. Direct the learners to take the one labeled “OS-M3-S5-GitHub-starting_survey”.  - Use free survey software such as Particify to establish this. You can use the example survey, edit it or create your own. Make sure to have a QR code for easy scanning, as well as the link displayed on the slides."

Git runs locally on your computer but connects easily with platforms like GitHub for sharing.  - GitHub is an online platform that lets researchers store, share, and collaborate on code and projects using version control.  - A Git repository is a folder that contains your project files and is tracked by Git so you can see the full history of changes. This folder can live locally on your computer or online, for example, a GitHub repository is a one that’s hosted online on GitHub.  - A branch is a copy of your project where you can test changes without affecting the main version. The Main Branch is the stable, official version of your project. You can work on a branch, then merge your updates back into the main branch once they’re reviewed or ready.\nInstructor Notes: Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine existing concepts in relation to some key terms.

Did you face these challenges? Did similar or other challenges arise?\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: For many projects, researchers working collaboratively or in teams can encounter several challenges that affect progress. Poor communication is one such challenge where relying on tools like emails or messaging apps can become confusing or cause important information to be lost. Researchers who work from different institutions, locations, or time zones can find it difficult to update code or review the work of the other contributors. Limited transparency and visibility of things like analysis scripts or data processing steps can also be a barrier for collaborators or reviewers to see how results were produced. Reflect on your own experience working in a team… were any of these problems issues for you too?\nInstructor Notes: Bring the lesson to life by making it relatable. Ask learners to think about times they have experienced these or similar challenges. This way the solutions to these problems that GitHub provides will not seem too abstract and learners can begin thinking about how they would incorporate working on GitHub in their projects. Select a few challenges and discuss with your learners."

Using it for a collaborative project can solve the challenges we just looked at. GitHub improves communication with features like commit messages that describe the changes made and the option to have discussions alongside the code. By allowing teams to host and share repositories online, everyone can contribute from anywhere. This connects all the contributors on a shared online workspace without overwriting each other’s work. This also includes hosting and sharing project materials like the code used and anlysis scripts so that they can be visible by the public or only accessible by the team. By doing this, people can see the evolution of the research and how analyses were done. Ultimately, GitHub supports the core principles of Open Science: openness, transparency, and reproducibility.\nInstructor Notes:  - Aim: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic and how it can provide solutions to real problems that researchers face."

Git and GitHub make this possible by keeping track of every change, merging updates smoothly, and maintaining transparency. This approach makes teamwork easier and strengthens openness and reproducibility in research.

This image will be shown again at the end so learners can have a chance to view the diagram with a clearer understanding of what the terms mean.  An activity suggestion: Have learners work in pairs or small groups to discuss the question “What problems does this workflow solve?” Look at the diagram and reflect on some of the solutions GitHub provide and see where or what step in the workflow helps with the challenges in collaboration (for example: cloning the repo so the copy on the local device is still connected to the main project helps solve the issue of disconnected collaboration.)"

The first step is to make your own copy of the project repository to your GitHub account. To do this, you need to fork the repo, which means to copy it so that you have your own version where you can host your changes to send it with changes back to the main repository later.  How does this contribute towards collaboration? It enables multiple contributors to work on the project at the same time. The changes you make on your copy won’t affect the original project, so it becomes your personal workspace where you can freely test ideas ideas.\nInstructor Notes: This is where the practice repo you had set up comes in.

Compare what you have on your RStudio project to what is in your fork on GitHub.\nInstructor Notes: It would be helpful at this stage to point out the “params” sub-folder as one of the files here in the cloned repository. This is the sub-folder containing the R file that learners will need to copy in the next exercise."

Frequent commits help with resolving conflicts because they create clear checkpoints in your project’s history. GitHub also offers GitHub issues as a communication tool to resolve conflicts.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project after you make changes. Each commit records what was changed, when, and by whom. You usually include a short message describing the update, for example, “Updated code for analysis,” and saves it in Git’s version history.  How does this contribute towards collaboration? Frequent commits records the progress of each contributor in small, trackable steps. It let’s others see what changes had been made. Frequent commits also make it possible to review changes if something breaks because now you can go back, review changes, and isolate problems to fix it."

This is why you should pull upstream to update your local or forked repository with the latest changes from the original repo.  How does this contribute towards collaboration? It keeps your local copy updated with the changes in the main project, prevents outdated or conflicting edits, and synchronizes work across each contributor.\nInstructor Notes: Back to the learners! Here the learners will perform this task as they must now pull the changes that the instructor merged into the main repository. This means they will incorporate the changes into their individual copies of the project, emphasize that this is a process to keep all their copies up to date with the changes and contributions made."

    "text": "Collaborative coding with GitHub\nNow that you have all gained some experience working collaboratively using GitHub, let us reflect with some questions: \n\n1. How can collaborative coding with GitHub be useful?\n\n2. What potential problems could still arise using this workflow?\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: So, you have seen the full workflow in action and practiced collaborative coding facilitated by GitHub. Let’s reflect further on this experience, how could this be useful? Think about how this kind of collaborative coding can support your own research and projects.\nInstructor Notes: The aim of this slide is to work out the relevance of the topic to your learners. In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be applied in practise with specific examples. Examine downfalls and practical obstacles. Invite the learners to relate the practice from today’s session to their own experiences. This gives them a chance to think about how they may apply their new-found skills in collaborative coding with GitHub to their existing or upcoming projects. Then, ask learners to share or discuss in groups what they’ve come up with. Possible answers: - Version control means every change is tracked, so mistakes can be undone easily.  - It allows multiple people to work on the same project at once, even from different locations, without overwriting each other’s work. - By sharing code through repositories, others can reproduce your analyses and see exactly how results were produced. This strengthens both collaboration and scientific transparency. \nSome potential issues:\n\nMerge conflicts: When two people edit the same part of a file, Git cannot automatically merge the changes, leading to so-called merge conflicts.\nUnclear commit messages: Inconsistent or unclear commit messages or too many small commits can make it hard to track changes.\nPull request overload: Too many open pull requests can slow down reviews and lead to bottlenecks.\nCommunication issues: Lack of communication about who is working on what can lead to duplicated effort or conflicts."

That means it’s not just a tool — it’s a full language, built with researchers and data in mind.\nIt’s also free and open source, which means anyone can download and use it, and developers from all over the world contribute to improving it. This has resulted in a large online community — so if you ever run into a problem, chances are someone else has had the same issue and posted a solution online.\nAnd because of that community, there are also countless free learning resources: tutorials, blog posts, videos, books, and packages that extend R’s functionality.\nSo in short: R is powerful, flexible, and supported by a strong community — which is why it’s become such a widely used tool in quantitative research."

This is where you’ll usually write and edit your code.\nThe top right is the Environment pane, which shows the objects you’ve created — like datasets or functions — so you can always check what’s currently in your workspace.\nThe bottom left is the Console, where R actually runs your commands. If you type directly into R instead of using a script, this is where it happens.\nAnd finally, the bottom right is for Help, Plots, and Packages. So if you ask for help on a function, create a plot, or install a new package, it’ll show up here.\nSo, RStudio combines everything in one interface to help you keep track of your code, your results, and your progress as you go."

One of its basic features, that is needed for many of its more complex functions are logical comparisons.\nWe can compare two numbers to determine if they are equal or unequal and check if a number is larger or smaller than another number. Comparisons like that are answered by R with either TRUE(yes) or FALSE (no). These comparisons are called logical comparisons. We can also combine logical comparisons using the logical AND, OR, and NOT to formulate longer statements."

We have learned what we can use R for and we tested some features of R in RStudio, such as data manipulation, reshaping, functions, plotting etc. Next, what we want to use this session is once again use these skills within RStudio, but with a stronger focus on enhancing the reproducibility of our work. We also want to increase our own responsibility for the steps we are taking within the research process. We will start to learn about tools that can help us to facilitate collaboration across different parties and maybe even disciplines, and we will put a special focus on being transparent in every step so that our methods and decision making process is clear to others that come across our work.\nInstructor Notes: \n\nAim: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.\nRemind learners what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is."

Use the think-pair-share paradigm: 1) THINK: learners first write down for themselves what they understand by these concepts. 2) PAIR: form pairs among your learners and have them discuss their current understanding of these concepts. 3) SHARE: Ask for volunteer pairs to share they conclusions and thought process.  Compare the descriptions provided by the learners: Are there any visible divergences or central aspects that they did not mention or mentioned differently?

This means that anyone who follows the same steps, using the same data and tools, should be able to achieve the same results. Reproducibility is essential in science and research because it helps verify findings, promotes transparency, and allows others to build on your work. By creating workflows that are transparent, well-documented, and accessible, you ensure that your research is both credible and trustworthy.\nRStudio Project: An RStudio Project is a convenient way to organize all the files related to a specific R project in one centralized location. This includes not only your R scripts but also any data, workspace settings, history, and outputs. By creating a project in RStudio and a corresponding .Rproj, you make it easier to maintain a consistent working environment, ensuring that everything you need is in one place. This organization is especially useful when sharing projects with collaborators or when you need to continue working on a project at a later time, as it simplifies managing dependencies and avoids issues related to missing files or incorrect paths.\nGit: Git is a popular version control system that helps you track and manage changes to your files and code. With Git, you can create commits, which are snapshots of your project at specific points in time. This makes it easy to monitor your progress, and roll back changes if needed. Git also supports branching, allowing you to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main project. Git’s decentralized nature means that each contributor has a full copy of the project’s history, ensuring robust tracking and flexibility.\nGitHub: GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that facilitates version control and collaboration. It hosts Git repositories online, making it easy to share your code with others, contribute to open-source projects, and track issues or bugs. GitHub offers additional features like pull requests, which allow collaborators to propose changes to a project and review those changes before they are merged into the main codebase. It also provides tools for project management, documentation, and continuous integration, making it an essential tool for modern software development and collaboration.\nRepositories: Git terminology for a folder whose content is tracked by Git"

This might look funny, but we have all been there, whether it’s a paper draft, a dataset, or an analysis script. File and data management is hard, and we have to somehow juggle multiple versions of files, so it is easy to lose track of which version is the “right” one.\nInstructor Notes: Adjust the example to tailor it to the main file type of your audience. Perhaps even show your own data organisation system from a project from many years ago to make learners relate more. Ask for volunteers to describe their current document management strategies."

It could be a coffee spill, a dropped laptop, a lost USB drive, or a hard disk crash, all different flavors of the same disaster and very realistic scenarios in student and researcher life.\nInstructor Notes: Describe an example from your own research or student career and describe the impact it had at the time. This is another reason why version control systems like Git, especially when used with remote hosting services such as GitHub, are so powerful. They do not just track your changes; they back up your work in multiple locations, so even if your laptop meets an unfortunate end, your work does not."

You decide to copy that folder over but are now wondering what the last thing you did was and how you solved the assignment last time. Sometimes it takes months or years until you come back to your old project, and it is almost impossible to remember why we made certain changes, what data we used, or how the results were produced, especially if all we have are scattered files in random folder with no context.\nInstructor Notes: Additional speaker notes for clarity: We’ve all opened an old project and thought, “What was I even doing here?” Without clear records, it’s impossible to remember how results were produced or why changes were made. This is where Git comes in, because changes are tracked and years later, you see exactly what you did and why."

Specifically, it saves the difference between two files It enables you to track the history of modifications, making it easy to see who changed what, when, and why. This is particularly valuable when working on code or large projects with many files, as it helps you manage different versions, and recover previous versions if something goes wrong. With version control, you can safely experiment with new changes without fear of losing important work, as you can always revert to a stable version of the project.\nInstructor Notes: Take your time with this section as it explains the WHY of version control. Learners should recognize their own challenges and be curious about how exactly one could overcome these challenges. More importantly, they should get a first idea how version control could be a tool to overcome their own challenges and that therefore it could be beneficial for them personally."

    "section": "The Git - GitHub workflow",
    "text": "The Git - GitHub workflow\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Let’s break down the basic steps of how Git and GitHub work together:\n\nLocal repository (aka your computer): When you start working on a project, you create a local repository on your computer. This is simply a folder where all your project files are kept. Git helps you track changes to these files over time by taking snapshots of them every time you save or modify something important. For example, imagine you’re writing code or working on a document. Each time you make significant changes, you can use Git to save a snapshot (called a commit) of your work. This allows you to keep track of your progress, go back to previous versions if needed, and see what changes have been made.\nRemote repository (GitHub): While your local repository is on your computer, GitHub is a platform on the internet that hosts your project remotely. Think of GitHub as a cloud-based storage for your project, where you can store the most up-to-date version of your work. Having a remote repository on GitHub is also helpful if you’re collaborating with others. Instead of sending files back and forth, everyone can work on the same project from their own computers and update GitHub with their changes.\nPushing changes to GitHub: Once you have made changes to your files and are happy with them, you can push those changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To “push” means to send your local changes to GitHub, making them available to anyone else who is working on the project. Think of pushing like uploading your updated work to the cloud.\nPulling changes from GitHub:If you are collaborating with others, or if someone else has made changes to the project, you will need to make sure your local project is up-to-date. To do this, you can pull the latest version from GitHub. Pulling means downloading the latest version of the project from GitHub to your computer. This ensures that you have all the recent changes made by others, and it helps avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on the same project at the same time.\n\nInstructor Notes: Take your time when explaining this workflow. If this slide is still too difficult to grasp, here is an even simpler explanation:\n\nStarting a project: You create a new project on your computer and initialize a local repository to start tracking your changes with Git.\nMaking changes: You write code or update documents. Every time you reach an important milestone, you save those changes with Git by making a commit.\nPushing to GitHub: When you’re ready to share your progress with others (or back it up), you push your changes to GitHub. Now, your work is safely stored online.\nPulling updates: If someone else is working on the project or you’ve been away for a while, you can pull the latest changes from GitHub to your computer. This keeps your local copy in sync with everyone else’s work."

Once the download is complete, run the .exe installer file. During the installation process, simply accept all the default settings and continue clicking ‘Next’ until the installation is finished. There’s no need to make any changes to the default options unless you have specific preferences. This will set up Git on your Windows machine with minimal effort.\nInstructor Notes: Work alongslide your learners from a new laptop that does not have Git installed yet and leave enough time for learners to follow along. Check in regularly to detect issues. Whenever technical issues need to be dealt with, ask around if anyone experienced may jump in so you do not have to solve everything yourself."

If the keys match, you’re granted access. Setting up the SSH key has to be executed once per GitHub account and for each computer you will use to connect to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Before you can interact with GitHub repositories, GitHub needs to recognize you and your machine. This is important to ensure that only authorized users can access and make changes to repositories. One common way to authenticate yourself and your machine is by using SSH keys.\nSSH keys work by pairing a public key with a private key. The public key is shared with GitHub and stored on their servers, while the private key stays securely on your computer. When you try to connect to GitHub, it checks if the public and private keys match. If they do, you’re granted access.\nNote that setting up SSH keys is something you only need to do once per GitHub account. However, you will need to set up separate keys for each computer you use to connect to GitHub. This ensures that every device you use has its own secure authentication.\nRemember, once the SSH keys are set up, they streamline your workflow with GitHub, allowing you to securely push, pull, and interact with repositories without needing to repeatedly enter your credentials.\nInstructor Notes: Depending on the technical experience of the audience, go into more or less details about SSH keys. Stress that you need SSH keys to secure the connection between a specific computer and a specific GitHub account."

You can simply use the existing key, which can save you time and avoid disrupting any current connections you have set up.In this first step we will check for an existing SSH key on different operating systems:\n\nFor Windows: Start by opening Git Bash. You can find it by searching for “Git Bash” in the Start menu. Once it’s open, navigate to the .ssh directory to see if a key already exists.\nFor macOS: On a Mac, open the Terminal app. You can find it by searching for “Terminal” in Spotlight or by navigating to Applications &gt; Utilities. From there, you can check the .ssh folder to look for any existing keys.\nFor Linux: If you are using Linux, open any terminal emulator you prefer, whether it’s the default terminal for your distribution or a third-party app. Then, check the .ssh directory for any existing SSH keys.\n\nInstructor Notes: Make sure to leave enough time for learners to follow the instructions based on their operating system."

After staging your changes, you create a “commit,” which is like taking a snapshot of your project at that moment. When you commit, you also write a short message describing what changes you made (e.g., “added new analysis to script”). This helps you keep track of what’s been done over time and allows you to go back to previous versions if needed. Taken together, staging is selecting the changes you want to keep, and committing is actually saving those changes with a description for future reference.\nInstructor Notes: Check if staging and committing have been understood as concepts before continuing."

Then click on Commit.\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: You want to specify what changes exactly you have made. This can be done via a commit message. Writing a good commit message is essential for keeping track of the changes you make to your project. Clear and concise commit messages help you and others understand the purpose of each change, making it easier to review or roll back changes later.\nInstructor Notes: Here are some tips for writing helpful commit messages:\n\nBe clear and specific: A commit message should clearly describe what changes you’ve made. Instead of something vague like “updated script,” be specific—like “added data cleaning steps to the script” or “fixed typo in analysis code.”\nUse the imperative mood: Commit messages are usually written in the imperative mood, as if giving a command. For example, instead of “I added a new function,” say “Add function to calculate summary statistics.” This keeps messages consistent and to the point.\nKeep it brief: Your commit message does not need to be long. Aim for a short, clear description. If the change requires more explanation, you can provide additional details in the commit body (though a short, effective title is usually enough).\nDescribe the Why, not just the What: If you are fixing a bug or adding a feature, include why you made the change. For example, “Fix issue where NA values caused the analysis to fail” is more useful than just “Fix bug.”"

When you push, you are sending your latest commits (the saved changes) to GitHub, making them available for others or for backup.\nPulling means downloading the latest changes from the remote repository to your local project. If someone else has made changes to the project or you’ve worked on it from another computer, pulling updates your local version with those new changes.\nIn short, pushing uploads your work, and pulling brings in updates from others."

This allows you to see how your project evolves over time.\nMakes mistakes easy to fix: If something goes wrong, you can easily revert to an earlier version of your project, making mistakes much easier to fix without losing progress.\nImproves reproducibility: With Git, you can track what changes were made, when they were made, and why. This helps you maintain a clear record of your work, which is especially useful for reproducing results or sharing your process with others.\nProvides a backup via GitHub: By pushing your project to GitHub, you create a secure backup of your work. Plus, you can easily share your project and access it from anywhere.\nIn short, Git not only helps manage changes and mistakes but also enhances the reproducibility and accessibility of your work.\n\nInstructor Notes:  - Aim: To work out the relevance of the topic to your learners. - In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be applied in practice with specific examples. - Examine downfalls and practical obstacles."
