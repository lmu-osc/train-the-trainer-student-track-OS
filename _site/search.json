We also want to increase our own responsibility for the steps we are taking within the research process. We will start to learn about tools that can help us to facilitate collaboration across different parties and maybe even disciplines, and we will put a special focus on being transparent in every step so that our methods and decision making process is clear to others that come across our work.\nInstructor Notes: \n\nAim: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.\nRemind learners what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is."

This means that anyone who follows the same steps, using the same data and tools, should be able to achieve the same results. Reproducibility is essential in science and research because it helps verify findings, promotes transparency, and allows others to build on your work. By creating workflows that are transparent, well-documented, and accessible, you ensure that your research is both credible and trustworthy.\nRStudio Project: An RStudio Project is a convenient way to organize all the files related to a specific R project in one centralized location. This includes not only your R scripts but also any data, workspace settings, history, and outputs. By creating a project in RStudio and a corresponding .Rproj, you make it easier to maintain a consistent working environment, ensuring that everything you need is in one place. This organization is especially useful when sharing projects with collaborators or when you need to continue working on a project at a later time, as it simplifies managing dependencies and avoids issues related to missing files or incorrect paths.\nGit: Git is a popular version control system that helps you track and manage changes to your files and code. With Git, you can create commits, which are snapshots of your project at specific points in time. This makes it easy to monitor your progress, and roll back changes if needed. Git also supports branching, allowing you to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main project. Git’s decentralized nature means that each contributor has a full copy of the project’s history, ensuring robust tracking and flexibility.\nGitHub: GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that facilitates version control and collaboration. It hosts Git repositories online, making it easy to share your code with others, contribute to open-source projects, and track issues or bugs. GitHub offers additional features like pull requests, which allow collaborators to propose changes to a project and review those changes before they are merged into the main codebase. It also provides tools for project management, documentation, and continuous integration, making it an essential tool for modern software development and collaboration.\nRepositories: Git terminology for a folder whose content is tracked by Git"

    "section": "The Git - GitHub workflow",
    "text": "The Git - GitHub workflow\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Let’s break down the basic steps of how Git and GitHub work together:\n\nLocal repository (aka your computer): When you start working on a project, you create a local repository on your computer. This is simply a folder where all your project files are kept. Git helps you track changes to these files over time by taking snapshots of them every time you save or modify something important. For example, imagine you’re writing code or working on a document. Each time you make significant changes, you can use Git to save a snapshot (called a commit) of your work. This allows you to keep track of your progress, go back to previous versions if needed, and see what changes have been made.\nRemote repository (GitHub): While your local repository is on your computer, GitHub is a platform on the internet that hosts your project remotely. Think of GitHub as a cloud-based storage for your project, where you can store the most up-to-date version of your work. Having a remote repository on GitHub is also helpful if you’re collaborating with others. Instead of sending files back and forth, everyone can work on the same project from their own computers and update GitHub with their changes.\nPushing changes to GitHub: Once you have made changes to your files and are happy with them, you can push those changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To “push” means to send your local changes to GitHub, making them available to anyone else who is working on the project. Think of pushing like uploading your updated work to the cloud.\nPulling changes from GitHub:If you are collaborating with others, or if someone else has made changes to the project, you will need to make sure your local project is up-to-date. To do this, you can pull the latest version from GitHub. Pulling means downloading the latest version of the project from GitHub to your computer. This ensures that you have all the recent changes made by others, and it helps avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on the same project at the same time.\n\nInstructor Notes: Take your time when explaining this workflow. If this slide is still too difficult to grasp, here is an even simpler explanation:\n\nStarting a project: You create a new project on your computer and initialize a local repository to start tracking your changes with Git.\nMaking changes: You write code or update documents. Every time you reach an important milestone, you save those changes with Git by making a commit.\nPushing to GitHub: When you’re ready to share your progress with others (or back it up), you push your changes to GitHub. Now, your work is safely stored online.\nPulling updates: If someone else is working on the project or you’ve been away for a while, you can pull the latest changes from GitHub to your computer. This keeps your local copy in sync with everyone else’s work."

The public key is shared with GitHub and stored on their servers, while the private key stays securely on your computer. When you try to connect to GitHub, it checks if the public and private keys match. If they do, you’re granted access.\nNote that setting up SSH keys is something you only need to do once per GitHub account. However, you will need to set up separate keys for each computer you use to connect to GitHub. This ensures that every device you use has its own secure authentication.\nRemember, once the SSH keys are set up, they streamline your workflow with GitHub, allowing you to securely push, pull, and interact with repositories without needing to repeatedly enter your credentials.\nInstructor Notes: Depending on the technical experience of the audience, go into more or less details about SSH keys. Stress that you need SSH keys to secure the connection between a specific computer and a specific GitHub account."

If you already have an SSH key pair, there is no need to generate a new one. You can simply use the existing key, which can save you time and avoid disrupting any current connections you have set up.In this first step we will check for an existing SSH key on different operating systems:\n\nFor Windows: Start by opening Git Bash. You can find it by searching for “Git Bash” in the Start menu. Once it’s open, navigate to the .ssh directory to see if a key already exists.\nFor macOS: On a Mac, open the Terminal app. You can find it by searching for “Terminal” in Spotlight or by navigating to Applications &gt; Utilities. From there, you can check the .ssh folder to look for any existing keys.\nFor Linux: If you are using Linux, open any terminal emulator you prefer, whether it’s the default terminal for your distribution or a third-party app. Then, check the .ssh directory for any existing SSH keys.\n\nInstructor Notes: Make sure to leave enough time for learners to follow the instructions based on their operating system."

Answer a few questions to check your current understanding of version control and the topics we discussed in this first part of the class.\nInstructor Notes: This pre-break survey serves to examine learners’ current understanding of key concepts of the submodule. Guidance on interpreting the results:\n\nIf more than 80% of the learners select the correct response option, show which one it is and move on.\nIf less than 80% of answers are correct, let them discuss with each other for 1-2 minutes which one they selected, and why, and afterwards let them re-take the question. If they`re above 80% correct the second time, move on, else show the correct response and explain why it is correct (plus maybe why the others are not).\nIf more than 30% select a specific distractor answer, discuss it in class.\n\nAccessibility Tip: This slide only works in a synchronous setting, skip if appropriate."

Staging is like preparing your changes before saving them. When you make changes to a file (like adding new code), Git doesn’t automatically track those changes.

After staging your changes, you create a “commit,” which is like taking a snapshot of your project at that moment. When you commit, you also write a short message describing what changes you made (e.g., “added new analysis to script”). This helps you keep track of what’s been done over time and allows you to go back to previous versions if needed. Taken together, staging is selecting the changes you want to keep, and committing is actually saving those changes with a description for future reference.\nInstructor Notes: Check if staging and committing have been understood as concepts before continuing."

Then click on Commit.\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: You want to specify what changes exactly you have made. This can be done via a commit message. Writing a good commit message is essential for keeping track of the changes you make to your project. Clear and concise commit messages help you and others understand the purpose of each change, making it easier to review or roll back changes later.\nInstructor Notes: Here are some tips for writing helpful commit messages:\n\nBe clear and specific: A commit message should clearly describe what changes you’ve made. Instead of something vague like “updated script,” be specific—like “added data cleaning steps to the script” or “fixed typo in analysis code.”\nUse the imperative mood: Commit messages are usually written in the imperative mood, as if giving a command. For example, instead of “I added a new function,” say “Add function to calculate summary statistics.” This keeps messages consistent and to the point.\nKeep it brief: Your commit message does not need to be long. Aim for a short, clear description. If the change requires more explanation, you can provide additional details in the commit body (though a short, effective title is usually enough).\nDescribe the Why, not just the What: If you are fixing a bug or adding a feature, include why you made the change. For example, “Fix issue where NA values caused the analysis to fail” is more useful than just “Fix bug.”"

Here is the process:\n\nMake changes locally: Start by editing your files, whether it is updating code, adding new content, or modifying existing data.\nStage changes locally: After making changes, you’ll select which changes you want to keep by staging them. This prepares them for committing.\nCommit changes locally with a commit message: Once your changes are staged, you commit them with a message that explains what was changed. This helps keep track of your project’s history.\nPush local changes to the remote repository on GitHub: Finally, after committing, you push your changes to GitHub, syncing your local work with the remote repository and making it available online."

This is another reason why version control systems like Git, especially when used with remote hosting services such as GitHub, are so powerful. They do not just track your changes; they back up your work in multiple locations, so even if your laptop meets an unfortunate end, your work does not."

You decide to copy that folder over but are now wondering what the last thing you did was and how you solved the assignment last time. Sometimes it takes months or years until you come back to your old project, and it is almost impossible to remember why we made certain changes, what data we used, or how the results were produced, especially if all we have are scattered files in random folder with no context.\nInstructor Notes: Additional speaker notes for clarity: We’ve all opened an old project and thought, “What was I even doing here?” Without clear records, it’s impossible to remember how results were produced or why changes were made. This is where Git comes in, because changes are tracked and years later, you see exactly what you did and why."

Git makes this safe: you can experiment on a branch, and if it fails, simply return to the last working version."

That means it’s not just a tool — it’s a full language, built with researchers and data in mind.\nIt’s also free and open source, which means anyone can download and use it, and developers from all over the world contribute to improving it. This has resulted in a large online community — so if you ever run into a problem, chances are someone else has had the same issue and posted a solution online.\nAnd because of that community, there are also countless free learning resources: tutorials, blog posts, videos, books, and packages that extend R’s functionality.\nSo in short: R is powerful, flexible, and supported by a strong community — which is why it’s become such a widely used tool in quantitative research."

It’s a free and open-source editor specifically designed for R, and it makes things much easier — both for writing code and for organizing your work.\nOn this slide, you can see the four main panes of the RStudio interface:\nThe top left pane is where your scripts or other files appear. This is where you’ll usually write and edit your code.\nThe top right is the Environment pane, which shows the objects you’ve created — like datasets or functions — so you can always check what’s currently in your workspace.\nThe bottom left is the Console, where R actually runs your commands. If you type directly into R instead of using a script, this is where it happens.\nAnd finally, the bottom right is for Help, Plots, and Packages. So if you ask for help on a function, create a plot, or install a new package, it’ll show up here.\nSo, RStudio combines everything in one interface to help you keep track of your code, your results, and your progress as you go."

Comparisons like that are answered by R with either TRUE(yes) or FALSE (no). These comparisons are called logical comparisons.

Data that are numbers can be further differentiated into numeric values, also known as double, and integers. Numeric variables have decimals, integers do not. Values that are words are normally either characters or factors. Characters have to be written in quotation marks. Factors have prespecified levels, such as brown, blonde, and black for a variable “hair color”.\nDepending on which type a variable has, different operations can be performed with it."

However, once we close R, everything typed into the console will be lost. To make our work traceable and reproducible, it makes sense to save the code we used. One way of saving and sharing code are R scripts. To run code from an R script, put the cursor anywhere in the respective line of code or mark everything you want to execute. Then press Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or ⌘ + Enter (Mac).\nIf you want to take notes or write anything that is not code into an R script, type # and then type your text."

Each submodule topic will include corresponding Tasks- adopting a “learn by doing” approach. - Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with the learning objective(s). - It’s useful to have exercises directly after a topic is taught to reinforce what was learnt.\nFor students who advance faster: Prepare extra exercises."

Both modes work with the same file, but they provide slightly different experiences. In this lesson, most of our tasks will be done in Source mode, but you’ll also have a chance to try Visual mode so you can compare how the same content looks and feels in each."

For example, we can choose whether to show or hide the code itself, whether readers can fold code open and closed, or whether only the results are shown. - Currently in our YAML, we have it set to code-fold: false which means the code is displayed as in the image. - These settings don’t change the analysis, but just change how it’s displayed. This flexibility is helpful because sometimes we want to highlight the process by showing the code, and other times we want readers to focus on the results. - In open research, showing the underlying code isn’t just a technical choice, it’s important for building trust and reproducibility."
