That means it’s not just a tool — it’s a full language, built with researchers and data in mind.\nIt’s also free and open source, which means anyone can download and use it, and developers from all over the world contribute to improving it. This has resulted in a large online community — so if you ever run into a problem, chances are someone else has had the same issue and posted a solution online.\nAnd because of that community, there are also countless free learning resources: tutorials, blog posts, videos, books, and packages that extend R’s functionality.\nSo in short: R is powerful, flexible, and supported by a strong community — which is why it’s become such a widely used tool in quantitative research."

It’s a free and open-source editor specifically designed for R, and it makes things much easier — both for writing code and for organizing your work.\nOn this slide, you can see the four main panes of the RStudio interface:\nThe top left pane is where your scripts or other files appear. This is where you’ll usually write and edit your code.\nThe top right is the Environment pane, which shows the objects you’ve created — like datasets or functions — so you can always check what’s currently in your workspace.\nThe bottom left is the Console, where R actually runs your commands. If you type directly into R instead of using a script, this is where it happens.\nAnd finally, the bottom right is for Help, Plots, and Packages. So if you ask for help on a function, create a plot, or install a new package, it’ll show up here.\nSo, RStudio combines everything in one interface to help you keep track of your code, your results, and your progress as you go."
