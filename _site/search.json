We have learned what we can use R for and we tested some features of R in RStudio, such as data manipulation, reshaping, functions, plotting etc. Next, what we want to use this session is once again use these skills within RStudio, but with a stronger focus on enhancing the reproducibility of our work. We also want to increase our own responsibility for the steps we are taking within the research process. We will start to learn about tools that can help us to facilitate collaboration across different parties and maybe even disciplines, and we will put a special focus on being transparent in every step so that our methods and decision making process is clear to others that come across our work.\nInstructor Notes:  - Aim: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context. - Remind students what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is."

That means it’s not just a tool — it’s a full language, built with researchers and data in mind.\nIt’s also free and open source, which means anyone can download and use it, and developers from all over the world contribute to improving it. This has resulted in a large online community — so if you ever run into a problem, chances are someone else has had the same issue and posted a solution online.\nAnd because of that community, there are also countless free learning resources: tutorials, blog posts, videos, books, and packages that extend R’s functionality.\nSo in short: R is powerful, flexible, and supported by a strong community — which is why it’s become such a widely used tool in quantitative research."

It’s a free and open-source editor specifically designed for R, and it makes things much easier — both for writing code and for organizing your work.\nOn this slide, you can see the four main panes of the RStudio interface:\nThe top left pane is where your scripts or other files appear. This is where you’ll usually write and edit your code.\nThe top right is the Environment pane, which shows the objects you’ve created — like datasets or functions — so you can always check what’s currently in your workspace.\nThe bottom left is the Console, where R actually runs your commands. If you type directly into R instead of using a script, this is where it happens.\nAnd finally, the bottom right is for Help, Plots, and Packages. So if you ask for help on a function, create a plot, or install a new package, it’ll show up here.\nSo, RStudio combines everything in one interface to help you keep track of your code, your results, and your progress as you go."

Comparisons like that are answered by R with either TRUE(yes) or FALSE (no). These comparisons are called logical comparisons.

However, once we close R, everything typed into the console will be lost. To make our work traceable and reproducible, it makes sense to save the code we used. One way of saving and sharing code are R scripts. To run code from an R script, put the cursor anywhere in the respective line of code or mark everything you want to execute. Then press Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or ⌘ + Enter (Mac).\nIf you want to take notes or write anything that is not code into an R script, type # and then type your text."

Each submodule topic will include corresponding Tasks- adopting a “learn by doing” approach. - Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with the learning objective(s). - It’s useful to have exercises directly after a topic is taught to reinforce what was learnt.\nFor students who advance faster: Prepare extra exercises."

Both modes work with the same file, but they provide slightly different experiences. In this lesson, most of our tasks will be done in Source mode, but you’ll also have a chance to try Visual mode so you can compare how the same content looks and feels in each."

For example, we can choose whether to show or hide the code itself, whether readers can fold code open and closed, or whether only the results are shown. - Currently in our YAML, we have it set to code-fold: false which means the code is displayed as in the image. - These settings don’t change the analysis, but just change how it’s displayed. This flexibility is helpful because sometimes we want to highlight the process by showing the code, and other times we want readers to focus on the results. - In open research, showing the underlying code isn’t just a technical choice, it’s important for building trust and reproducibility."
