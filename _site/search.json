Doing this allows you as the instructor to view the pull requests made to this fork and subsequently merge them (OSC has ownership of the original repo and so any pull requests to that repo would require their approval). It is advisable to do this before the session so that on the day of the lesson, you can easily give the learners a link to access this main repository.

Git runs locally on your computer but connects easily with platforms like GitHub for sharing.  - GitHub is an online platform that lets researchers store, share, and collaborate on code and projects using version control.  - A Git repository is a folder that contains your project files and is tracked by Git so you can see the full history of changes. This folder can live locally on your computer or online, for example, a GitHub repository is a one that’s hosted online on GitHub.  - A branch is a copy of your project where you can test changes without affecting the main version. The Main Branch is the stable, official version of your project. You can work on a branch, then merge your updates back into the main branch once they’re reviewed or ready.\nInstructor Notes: Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine existing concepts in relation to some key terms.

Did you face these challenges? Did similar or other challenges arise?\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: For many projects, researchers working collaboratively or in teams can encounter several challenges that affect progress. Poor communication is one such challenge where relying on tools like emails or messaging apps can become confusing or cause important information to be lost. Researchers who work from different institutions, locations, or time zones can find it difficult to update code or review the work of the other contributors. Limited transparency and visibility of things like analysis scripts or data processing steps can also be a barrier for collaborators or reviewers to see how results were produced. Reflect on your own experience working in a team… were any of these problems issues for you too?\nInstructor Notes: Bring the lesson to life by making it relatable. Ask learners to think about times they have experienced these or similar challenges. This way the solutions to these problems that GitHub provides will not seem too abstract and learners can begin thinking about how they would incorporate working on GitHub in their projects. Select a few challenges and discuss with your learners."

Using it for a collaborative project can solve the challenges we just looked at. GitHub improves communication with features like commit messages that describe the changes made and the option to have discussions alongside the code. By allowing teams to host and share repositories online, everyone can contribute from anywhere. This connects all the contributors on a shared online workspace without overwriting each other’s work. This also includes hosting and sharing project materials like the code used and anlysis scripts so that they can be visible by the public or only accessible by the team. By doing this, people can see the evolution of the research and how analyses were done. Ultimately, GitHub supports the core principles of Open Science: openness, transparency, and reproducibility.\nInstructor Notes:  - Aim: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic and how it can provide solutions to real problems that researchers face."

Git and GitHub make this possible by keeping track of every change, merging updates smoothly, and maintaining transparency. This approach makes teamwork easier and strengthens openness and reproducibility in research.

This image will be shown again at the end so learners can have a chance to view the diagram with a clearer understanding of what the terms mean.  An activity suggestion: Have learners work in pairs or small groups to discuss the question “What problems does this workflow solve?” Look at the diagram and reflect on some of the solutions GitHub provide and see where or what step in the workflow helps with the challenges in collaboration (for example: cloning the repo so the copy on the local device is still connected to the main project helps solve the issue of disconnected collaboration.)"

The first step is to make your own copy of the project repository to your GitHub account. To do this, you need to fork the repo, which means to copy it so that you have your own version where you can host your changes to send it with changes back to the main repository later.  How does this contribute towards collaboration? It enables multiple contributors to work on the project at the same time. The changes you make on your copy won’t affect the original project, so it becomes your personal workspace where you can freely test ideas ideas.\nInstructor Notes: This is where the practice repo you had set up comes in.

You can now have a copy of the project files on your local device that’s still connected to the online repository and it makes it easy to sync updates between contributors.\nInstructor Notes: Both forking and cloning involve making copies of the repo but to different locations, so make this distinction clear. If there is any confusion, you can go back to the first diagram of the workflow to visualize the difference."

Each commit records what was changed, when, and by whom. You usually include a short message describing the update, for example, “Updated code for analysis,” and saves it in Git’s version history.  How does this contribute towards collaboration? Frequent commits records the progress of each contributor in small, trackable steps. It let’s others see what changes had been made. Frequent commits also make it possible to review changes if something breaks because now you can go back, review changes, and isolate problems to fix it."

Depending on the size of the class, it may be too time-consuming to review and merge the changes from each individual learner.  - For this particular project, the things you want to check for during your review is that each new file has the 3 elements in the correct format: ‘sig2’ is a numerical value between 1-5 with no quotation marks; ‘species.name’ has quotation marks; ‘color’ is a hex code starting with a # followed by 6 characters and is in quotation marks. Errors here can break the code.  - When you open the “plot-trait-evolution.Rmd” file, you would have to install and load the necessary packages before hitting ‘Knit’- the packages are detailed in the file itself. - Note this demo is only suitable for a class-room setting."

How can collaborative coding with GitHub be useful?\n\n2. What potential problems could still arise using this workflow?\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: So, you have seen the full workflow in action and practiced collaborative coding facilitated by GitHub. Let’s reflect further on this experience, how could this be useful? Think about how this kind of collaborative coding can support your own research and projects.\nInstructor Notes: The aim of this slide is to work out the relevance of the topic to your learners. In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be applied in practise with specific examples. Examine downfalls and practical obstacles. Invite the learners to relate the practice from today’s session to their own experiences. This gives them a chance to think about how they may apply their new-found skills in collaborative coding with GitHub to their existing or upcoming projects. Then, ask learners to share or discuss in groups what they’ve come up with. Possible answers: - Version control means every change is tracked, so mistakes can be undone easily.  - It allows multiple people to work on the same project at once, even from different locations, without overwriting each other’s work. - By sharing code through repositories, others can reproduce your analyses and see exactly how results were produced. This strengthens both collaboration and scientific transparency. \nSome potential issues:\n\nMerge conflicts: When two people edit the same part of a file, Git cannot automatically merge the changes, leading to so-called merge conflicts.\nUnclear commit messages: Inconsistent or unclear commit messages or too many small commits can make it hard to track changes.\nPull request overload: Too many open pull requests can slow down reviews and lead to bottlenecks.\nCommunication issues: Lack of communication about who is working on what can lead to duplicated effort or conflicts."
