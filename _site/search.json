We have learned what we can use R for and we tested some features of R in RStudio, such as data manipulation, reshaping, functions, plotting etc. Next, what we want to use this session is once again use these skills within RStudio, but with a stronger focus on enhancing the reproducibility of our work. We also want to increase our own responsibility for the steps we are taking within the research process. We will start to learn about tools that can help us to facilitate collaboration across different parties and maybe even disciplines, and we will put a special focus on being transparent in every step so that our methods and decision making process is clear to others that come across our work.\nInstructor Notes: \n\nAim: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.\nRemind students what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is."

This means that anyone who follows the same steps, using the same data and tools, should be able to achieve the same results. Reproducibility is essential in science and research because it helps verify findings, promotes transparency, and allows others to build on your work. By creating workflows that are transparent, well-documented, and accessible, you ensure that your research is both credible and trustworthy.\nRStudio Project: An RStudio Project is a convenient way to organize all the files related to a specific R project in one centralized location. This includes not only your R scripts but also any data, workspace settings, history, and outputs. By creating a project in RStudio and a corresponding .Rproj, you make it easier to maintain a consistent working environment, ensuring that everything you need is in one place. This organization is especially useful when sharing projects with collaborators or when you need to continue working on a project at a later time, as it simplifies managing dependencies and avoids issues related to missing files or incorrect paths.\nGit: Git is a popular version control system that helps you track and manage changes to your files and code. With Git, you can create commits, which are snapshots of your project at specific points in time. This makes it easy to monitor your progress, and roll back changes if needed. Git also supports branching, allowing you to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main project. Git’s decentralized nature means that each contributor has a full copy of the project’s history, ensuring robust tracking and flexibility.\nGitHub: GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that facilitates version control and collaboration. It hosts Git repositories online, making it easy to share your code with others, contribute to open-source projects, and track issues or bugs. GitHub offers additional features like pull requests, which allow collaborators to propose changes to a project and review those changes before they are merged into the main codebase. It also provides tools for project management, documentation, and continuous integration, making it an essential tool for modern software development and collaboration.\nRepositories: Git terminology for a folder whose content is tracked by Git\n\nInstructor Notes: ADD"

    "section": "The Git - GitHub workflow",
    "text": "The Git - GitHub workflow\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Let’s break down the basic steps of how Git and GitHub work together:\n\nLocal Repository (Your Computer): When you start working on a project, you create a local repository on your computer. This is simply a folder where all your project files are kept. Git helps you track changes to these files over time by taking snapshots of them every time you save or modify something important. For example, imagine you’re writing code or working on a document. Each time you make significant changes, you can use Git to save a snapshot (called a commit) of your work. This allows you to keep track of your progress, go back to previous versions if needed, and see what changes have been made.\nRemote Repository (GitHub): While your local repository is on your computer, GitHub is a platform on the internet that hosts your project remotely. Think of GitHub as a cloud-based storage for your project, where you can store the most up-to-date version of your work. Having a remote repository on GitHub is also helpful if you’re collaborating with others. Instead of sending files back and forth, everyone can work on the same project from their own computers and update GitHub with their changes.\nPushing Changes to GitHub: Once you have made changes to your files and are happy with them, you can push those changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To “push” means to send your local changes to GitHub, making them available to anyone else who is working on the project. Think of pushing like uploading your updated work to the cloud.\nPulling Changes from GitHub:If you are collaborating with others, or if someone else has made changes to the project, you will need to make sure your local project is up-to-date. To do this, you can pull the latest version from GitHub. Pulling means downloading the latest version of the project from GitHub to your computer. This ensures that you have all the recent changes made by others, and it helps avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on the same project at the same time.\n\nInstructor Notes: Take your time when explaining this workflow. If this slide is still too difficult to grasp, here is an even simpler explanation:\n\nStarting a Project: You create a new project on your computer and initialize a local repository to start tracking your changes with Git.\nMaking Changes: You write code or update documents. Every time you reach an important milestone, you save those changes with Git by making a commit.\nPushing to GitHub: When you’re ready to share your progress with others (or back it up), you push your changes to GitHub. Now, your work is safely stored online.\nPulling Updates: If someone else is working on the project or you’ve been away for a while, you can pull the latest changes from GitHub to your computer. This keeps your local copy in sync with everyone else’s work."

If the keys match, you’re granted access. Setting up the SSH key has to be executed once per GitHub account and for each computer you will use to connect to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Before you can interact with GitHub repositories, GitHub needs to recognize you and your machine. This is important to ensure that only authorized users can access and make changes to repositories. One common way to authenticate yourself and your machine is by using SSH keys.\nSSH keys work by pairing a public key with a private key. The public key is shared with GitHub and stored on their servers, while the private key stays securely on your computer. When you try to connect to GitHub, it checks if the public and private keys match. If they do, you’re granted access.\nNote that setting up SSH keys is something you only need to do once per GitHub account. However, you will need to set up separate keys for each computer you use to connect to GitHub. This ensures that every device you use has its own secure authentication.\nRemember, once the SSH keys are set up, they streamline your workflow with GitHub, allowing you to securely push, pull, and interact with repositories without needing to repeatedly enter your credentials.\nInstructor Notes: Depending on the technical experience of the audience, go into more or less details about SSH keys. Stress that you need SSH keys to secure the connection between a specific computer and a specific GitHub account."

The second file is my_first_test_repo.Rproj (depending on how you named your porject file), which contains configuration information for your RStudio project.

After staging your changes, you create a “commit,” which is like taking a snapshot of your project at that moment. When you commit, you also write a short message describing what changes you made (e.g., “added new analysis to script”). This helps you keep track of what’s been done over time and allows you to go back to previous versions if needed. Taken together, staging is selecting the changes you want to keep, and committing is actually saving those changes with a description for future reference.\nInstructor Notes: Check if staging and committing have been understood as concepts before continuing."

Then click on Commit.\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: You want to specify what changes exactly you have made. This can be done via a commit message. Writing a good commit message is essential for keeping track of the changes you make to your project. Clear and concise commit messages help you and others understand the purpose of each change, making it easier to review or roll back changes later.\nInstructor Notes: Here are some tips for writing helpful commit messages:\n\nBe clear and specific: A commit message should clearly describe what changes you’ve made. Instead of something vague like “updated script,” be specific—like “added data cleaning steps to the script” or “fixed typo in analysis code.”\nUse the imperative mood: Commit messages are usually written in the imperative mood, as if giving a command. For example, instead of “I added a new function,” say “Add function to calculate summary statistics.” This keeps messages consistent and to the point.\nKeep it brief: Your commit message does not need to be long. Aim for a short, clear description. If the change requires more explanation, you can provide additional details in the commit body (though a short, effective title is usually enough).\nDescribe the Why, not just the What: If you are fixing a bug or adding a feature, include why you made the change. For example, “Fix issue where NA values caused the analysis to fail” is more useful than just “Fix bug.”"

Here is the process:\n\nMake changes locally: Start by editing your files, whether it is updating code, adding new content, or modifying existing data.\nStage changes locally: After making changes, you’ll select which changes you want to keep by staging them. This prepares them for committing.\nCommit changes locally with a commit message: Once your changes are staged, you commit them with a message that explains what was changed. This helps keep track of your project’s history.\nPush local changes to the remote repository on GitHub: Finally, after committing, you push your changes to GitHub, syncing your local work with the remote repository and making it available online."

This allows you to see how your project evolves over time.\nMakes mistakes easy to fix: If something goes wrong, you can easily revert to an earlier version of your project, making mistakes much easier to fix without losing progress.\nImproves reproducibility: With Git, you can track what changes were made, when they were made, and why. This helps you maintain a clear record of your work, which is especially useful for reproducing results or sharing your process with others.\nProvides a backup via GitHub: By pushing your project to GitHub, you create a secure backup of your work. Plus, you can easily share your project and access it from anywhere.\nIn short, Git not only helps manage changes and mistakes but also enhances the reproducibility and accessibility of your work.\n\nInstructor Notes:  - Aim: To work out the relevance of the topic to your students. - In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be applied in practise with specific examples. - Examine downfalls and practical obstacles."

You believe that the most likely explanation for this observation could be the quantity of salt.

Your task is to map out the individual steps of a hypothetical approach where you try to answer this question in a systematic way. Use the research cycle as your framework of reference.\nInstructor Notes: A plausible working example: - Observation: I notice that pasta seems to cook faster when the water is salted.\n\nDefine the question: Does pasta cook faster in salted water?\nResearch the topic area: What has been done before?\nDefine hypothesis: Pasta will cook faster in salted water than in unsalted water. My outcome variable is cooking time in seconds.\nTest with experiment: Define the amount of pasta, amount of water, amount of salt, average heat and the pot to cook the pasta in. Measure cooking time with a watch. Repeat the experiment many times.\nAnalyze data: Examine the data you collected and compare the cooking times between pasta cooked in salted vs. unsalted water.

    "text": "The research cycle\n\n\nwww.phdcomics.com\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Let us walk through this diagram of the scientific process. This is basically a visual representation of what research can mean. As you can see, the stages are arranged in a clockwise cycle, emphasizing that science is continuous and iterative. We begin with Observation or the question. This is where something in the world prompts us to ask why or how it works, or we made an observation and wonder about a particular feature or consequence. Next, we move into researching the topic area. Here we gather existing knowledge, review what others have discovered, and refine our understanding of the problem.\nBased on what we learn, we develop a hypothesis. This is a testable explanation or prediction that we can investigate. Importantly, a testable hypothesis is a precise statement, derived from your original question.\nThen comes testing with an experiment. This is where we design procedures to measure, observe, and collect data in a controlled, systematic way.\nAfter the experiment, we analyze the data. We look for patterns, compare results to our predictions, and determine whether the hypothesis holds up.\nFinally, we report our fundings and conclusions, together with our approach. This could be through a written paper, a presentation, or sharing findings with a research team. Importantly, these conclusions often lead to new questions, sending us back to the first stage and continuing the cycle of discovery.\nInstructor Notes: Add."

(2011); Protzko et al. (2023)\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: Different studies looked at the replicability of findings. They provide us with interesting and probably alarming results about whether independent researchers can repeat the study using new data and get the same overall findings or conclusions.\nAs you can see here, the dark red bars are the % of studies which were not successfully replicated. Psychology is quite up there, about 64% of all studies we conduct do not replicate. What is equally as worrying, if not more, are that 89% of studies from cancer research do not replicate either. The best field really is experimental philosophy, so from this, they have the most robust and credible scientific approach.\nA lot of aspects of these studies can be discussed - also critically discussed. For example: Were the studies selected randomly (or did they only select the studies that looked fishy from the start?). How do you even measure the „replicability“? Is simply looking for significance in the replications study sufficient or even useful? All of these are good points, and there is a whole emerging field that tackles these questions. It is called meta-science, and it takes a scientific view onto the scientific enterprise itself.\nProtzko et al. (2023): Original studies were preregistered, used large samples, and shared all research materials. Protzko and colleagues implemented these behaviors in a best-practice prospective replication study in which four independent laboratories replicated novel findings in a round-robin format. Suggesting that high replicability is achievable. This study does not, however, provide causal evidence of specific practices that increase replicability.\nInstructor Notes: Add."

Science, 349(6251), aac4716.\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: The Reproducibility Project by the Open Science Collaboration (2015) involved a large-scale, collaborative effort by over 270 researchers. They selected 100 experimental studies published between 2008 and 2012 in three top psychology journals: Psychological Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. For each study, they carefully reviewed the original materials, methods, and analyses, and often contacted the original authors for clarification or access to materials and protocols. Each replication aimed to match the original study’s sample size, experimental design, and analysis plan as closely as possible, while making only minimal changes when exact materials were unavailable. The replications were preregistered to specify hypotheses, design, and analysis before data collection, reducing bias and “researcher degrees of freedom.” Data collection was conducted independently from the original research teams, often in multiple labs to ensure rigor. After data collection, they analyzed the results using the same statistical methods as the original studies to determine whether the findings could be reproduced. The project also evaluated effect sizes, not just statistical significance, to compare the magnitude of the original and replicated effects. Only 39% of the replications produced statistically significant results, and the median effect size in replications was about half that of the original studies, highlighting the reproducibility challenges in psychology.\nInstructor Notes:"

Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy. New England Journal of Medicine, 358(3), 252-260. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa065779\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: In this study, the authors obtained the archive of clinical trials for 12 antidepressant drugs submitted the the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In total, the trials involved more than 12000 patients. They performed a systematic search to identify which of these trials had been published in the literature. For those that were published, the compared the published versions and results with the versions and results in the FDA documentation. There were 74 FDA-registered trials. Of those, 38 trials showed postive effects of antidepressant drugs, 36 showed negative effects of antidepressant drugs. This is a 51% - 49% split of results: about half of the FDA-registered trials showed a positive effect of antidepressant drugs, the other half showed a negative effect of antidepressant drugs. 37 of the 38 trials that showed positive effects were published in the literature, basically all of them except 1 trial. However, of the 36 trials that showed negative or no effects of antidepressant drugs, only 3 were published that included those exact findings. 22 of the 36 trials were not published at all, and the remaining 11 trials were published with the outcomes reframed in a more positive way. In the literature, in the end, we ended up with a total of 51 trials being published, 48 of which showed positive effects of antidepressant drugs on depression. That is 94% of this sample of papers. Only 6% (3 papers) showed a negative effect of antidepressant drugs on depression. As a consequence, those of us searching the literature for these papers, will get a distorted via of the effectiveness of antidepressants. Therefore, the authors were able to show a substantial publication bias in the antidepressant trial literature. Instructor Notes: Add."

Most troubling, 14 packages (58%) had results in the paper that differed from those generated by the author’s own code. The authors identified a number of mistakes in the analysis scripts that were submitted and in the results that were published, for example that the wrong signs used for reporting, coefficients were labelled the wrong way, descriptive statistics were imprecise or incorrect.

Research involves the formulation of hypothesis or proposition of solutions, data analysis, and deductions; and ascertaining whether the conclusions fit the hypothesis.

In their paper, Resnik argues that maintaining public trust is essential for the scientific enterprise, and he highlights how U.S. policy leaders have emphasized this responsibility. For example, he references the 2009 Committee on Science and Technology report, which highlights that the public expects science to be conducted responsibly and that preserving trust requires strong ethical norms, oversight, and systems that prevent misconduct. The part on “honest reflection of a researcher’s work is particularly central here: society should be able to get a reliable and truthful insight into the methods and outcomes of the research process. They also cite President Obama’s 2009 statement on scientific integrity, which stresses that government science must be guided by facts, transparency, and freedom from political manipulation. Resnik uses this to illustrate that public trust in science and research is not automatic. Going even further, they argue that trust needs to be earned and protected, given that science and research play a critical role in informing policies relevant to the public.\nInstructor Notes: Add."

B. (2011). Scientific research and the public trust. Science and engineering ethics, 17(3), 399-409.\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: When discussing the importance of trust in research by society, Resink highlights that trust is absolutely essential for effective collaboration in science. Researchers rely on one another in so many ways, e.g., co-authoring papers, reviewing each other’s work, sharing data, attempting replications, and even in day-to-day activities like teaching and mentoring. None of these collaborative practices would function smoothly without a basic level of confidence that everyone is acting with integrity.\nLikewise, when scientists read published research, they trust that the study was carried out as the authors describe. They expect that all the important methodological details are reported transparently, so the work can be evaluated or repeated. And they assume that the data are genuine, or in other words that nothing has been fabricated, falsified, or manipulated; intentionally or unintentionally. Without this trust in the accuracy and honesty of the research record, the entire scientific research process becomes unstable and no longer credible. Instructor Notes: Add."

They selected 100 experimental studies published between 2008 and 2012 in three top psychology journals: Psychological Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. For each study, they carefully reviewed the original materials, methods, and analyses, and often contacted the original authors for clarification or access to materials and protocols. Each replication aimed to match the original study’s sample size, experimental design, and analysis plan as closely as possible, while making only minimal changes when exact materials were unavailable. The replications were preregistered to specify hypotheses, design, and analysis before data collection, reducing bias and “researcher degrees of freedom.” Data collection was conducted independently from the original research teams, often in multiple labs to ensure rigor. After data collection, they analyzed the results using the same statistical methods as the original studies to determine whether the findings could be reproduced. The project also evaluated effect sizes, not just statistical significance, to compare the magnitude of the original and replicated effects. Only 39% of the replications produced statistically significant results, and the median effect size in replications was about half that of the original studies, highlighting the reproducibility challenges in psychology.\nInstructor Notes:"

    "section": "What is “research”?",
    "text": "What is “research”?\n\n\n“Research refers to a careful, well-defined (or redefined), objective, and systematic method of search for knowledge, or formulation of a theory that is driven by inquisitiveness for that which is unknown and useful on a particular aspect so as to make an original contribution to expand the existing knowledge base. Research involves the formulation of hypothesis or proposition of solutions, data analysis, and deductions; and ascertaining whether the conclusions fit the hypothesis. Research is a process of creating, or formulating knowledge that does not yet exist.”\n\n \n\nDeb, D., Dey, R., & Balas, V. E. (2018). Introduction: What is research? In Engineering Research Methodology: A Practical Insight for Researchers (pp. 1-7). Singapore: Springer Singapore.\n\n\nSpeaker Notes: As was also evident from our discussions from the previous exercise, research can take many forms, therefore finding an all-encompassing description can be tricky. The work by Deb and colleauges (2018) describes research in the following way: Research is a careful, well-defined, objective, and systematic process rather than a random or unstructured activity. It involves a deliberate search for knowledge or the formulation of theories that aim to explain aspects of reality that are not yet fully understood. This process is driven by inquisitiveness and a desire to explore what is unknown, unresolved, or potentially useful, with the ultimate goal of making an original contribution that expands the existing body of knowledge. Research does not simply repeat what is already known; instead, it seeks to refine, extend, or generate new understanding.\nCentral to the research process is the formulation of hypotheses or the proposition of possible solutions to identified problems. These guide the direction of inquiry and determine the type of data that must be collected. Through systematic data analysis and logical deduction, researchers evaluate evidence to determine whether their conclusions support or contradict the initial hypotheses. This evaluative step is essential, as it ensures that findings are grounded in evidence and coherent reasoning. Ultimately, research is a creative and constructive endeavor that results in the creation or formulation of knowledge that did not previously exist, thereby contributing meaningfully to scholarly and scientific advancement.\nInstructor Notes: Add."

    "text": "Human errors and honest mistakes\n“90% Excel-Gate”\n\n\n  \n\n\nSpeaker Notes: In their 2010 paper Growth in a Time of Debt, economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff claimed that when government debt exceeds 90% of GDP, economic growth falls sharply. Their findings strongly influenced debates about austerity policies. However, in 2013, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin from the University of Massachusetts–Amherst re-examined the data and found serious flaws: an Excel coding error that excluded several countries. In essence, what had happened was that when using a formula, the authors had made a mistake when selecting the range of cells where to apply the formula too. In this, they omitted some countries from the calculations.\nOnce corrected, the average growth rate for high-debt countries rose from –0.1% to about +2.2%, showing no clear “90% tipping point.” The original authors later acknowledged the spreadsheet error and issued a correction.
