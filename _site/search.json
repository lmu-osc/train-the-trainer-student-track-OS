That means it’s not just a tool — it’s a full language, built with researchers and data in mind.\nIt’s also free and open source, which means anyone can download and use it, and developers from all over the world contribute to improving it. This has resulted in a large online community — so if you ever run into a problem, chances are someone else has had the same issue and posted a solution online.\nAnd because of that community, there are also countless free learning resources: tutorials, blog posts, videos, books, and packages that extend R’s functionality.\nSo in short: R is powerful, flexible, and supported by a strong community — which is why it’s become such a widely used tool in quantitative research."

It’s a free and open-source editor specifically designed for R, and it makes things much easier — both for writing code and for organizing your work.\nOn this slide, you can see the four main panes of the RStudio interface:\nThe top left pane is where your scripts or other files appear. This is where you’ll usually write and edit your code.\nThe top right is the Environment pane, which shows the objects you’ve created — like datasets or functions — so you can always check what’s currently in your workspace.\nThe bottom left is the Console, where R actually runs your commands. If you type directly into R instead of using a script, this is where it happens.\nAnd finally, the bottom right is for Help, Plots, and Packages. So if you ask for help on a function, create a plot, or install a new package, it’ll show up here.\nSo, RStudio combines everything in one interface to help you keep track of your code, your results, and your progress as you go."

Each submodule topic will include corresponding Tasks- adopting a “learn by doing” approach. - Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with the learning objective(s). - It’s useful to have exercises directly after a topic is taught to reinforce what was learnt.\nFor students who advance faster: Prepare extra exercises."

In this lesson, you can try both to see which workflow feels more comfortable for you."

It holds the document’s settings, like the title, author, date, and output format. - Below that, we use Markdown to write the actual content which are things like headings, bullet points, bold or italic text."

For example, we can choose whether to show or hide the code itself, whether readers can fold code open and closed, or whether only the results are shown. - Currently in our YAML, we have it set to code-fold: false which means the code is displayed as in the image. - These settings don’t change the analysis, but just change how it’s displayed. This flexibility is helpful because sometimes we want to highlight the process by showing the code, and other times we want readers to focus on the results. - In open research, showing the underlying code isn’t just a technical choice, it’s important for building trust and reproducibility."

Re-examine formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson.\nSpeaker Notes - WYSIWYM is an acronym for “What You Say is What You Mean” which means that whatever you see in your document will be what you see even when you save or render the document as PDF or as HTML.\n\nQuarto documents can be created and edited in either Source mode or Visual mode. Both modes work with the same file, but they provide slightly different experiences. In this lesson, most of our tasks will be done in Source mode, but you’ll also have a chance to try Visual mode so you can compare how the same content looks and feels in each."

That’s an additional step."
