## Securing the connection between your computer and GitHub

You need to identify yourself and your machine to GitHub before interacting with GitHub repositories.

- **SSH keys** are a common way to manifest your identification to GitHub

::: {.callout-important}
**SSH keys** come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you’re granted access. Setting up the SSH key has to be executed once per GitHub account and for **each** computer you will use to connect to GitHub.

## Checking for existing SSH key pair

**Step 1**: Before generating a new SSH key pair, check for existing key in your .ssh directory.

- **Windows**: Open Git Bash (start menu > Git Bash)
- **MacOS**: Open Terminal App
- **Linux**: Open your distribution’s (or any other) terminal emulator

::: {.notes}

## Checking for existing SSH key pair

**Step 2**: Enter the following command to list the content of the ssh directory:

```text
ls ~/.ssh
```

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Add script for slide here. 
**Instructor  Notes**: On successful execution, students should see no output from these commands.  
:::

## Checking for existing SSH key pair

**Step 3**: If there are existing ssh keys, they are named one of the following: 

```text
id_rsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub
```
::: {.callout-important}
If you already have an SSH key pair, you can skip the section on how to generate a new SSH key pair. If you don’t have an existing public and private key pair (which is to be expected!), or if you receive an error that ~/.ssh doesn’t exist, that this file location doesn’t exist, or that you can’t access this folder, go ahead and generate a new SSH key pair.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Add script for slide here. 
**Instructor  Notes**: On successful execution, students should see no output from these commands.

---

## Generating a new SSH key pair

**Step 1**: In the command line, type the following (replacing the email here with your *own* email) to create a new SSH key pair with your email as a label. 

```text
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@email.com"
```

---

## Generating a new SSH key pair

**Step 3**: Next, you are asked to provide a passphrase in the terminal. Protecting your keys with a password is optional but highly recommended. Press ENTER after confirming your password. 

```text
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  
Enter same passphrase again:
```

::: {.callout-warning}
when you type passwords in the command line, **nothing** is displayed, not even ***, you are however still typing in the background.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Add script for slide here. 
**Instructor  Notes**: On successful execution, students should see no output from these commands.

## Generating a new SSH key pair

**Step 4**: When the key generation is complete, you should see the following confirmation:

```text
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:6nr/zo0g7Bz7WMRwy34maBhQy1UZyX47gT+egRdlIhs your_email@email.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+

## Adding the SSH key to *ssh-agent*

Managing your ssh keys is done via the [ssh-agent](https://smallstep.com/blog/ssh-agent-explained/) software.

::: {.callout-note}
Depending on your system, the following might not be necessary. On most GNU/Linux distributions, your key will be automatically added to the ssh-agent after the first time you enter it. If you keep getting asked for your key each time you want to clone or push to a GitHub repository, you can follow the  instructions on the next slides.

## Making changes

Now we want to make some actual changes to practise using Git and to show how Git handles modifications of files. <br>

**Step 1**: Add the following code to your existing R script

```text
# some guesses for the parameters.
p1 = 1
p2 = 0.2

# do the fit
fit = nls(ydata ~ p1*cos(p2*xdata) + p2*sin(p1*xdata), data = mydata, start = list(p1=p1,p2=p2))

## Practical exercise 1

- [ ] Stage the second script and write a new commit message. 
- [ ] In the git tab, press the **History** button to review the change and commit history of your files. 


::: {.callout-note}
By default, the history search feature will show all files added, changed, or deleted for each commit. This can be extremely useful for finding bugs or looking back to how your project looked a few months ago. However, it is often more practical to review the changes made to a single file over time; this enables, for example, clear tracking of the evolution of data cleaning and analysis steps in your project.
