# About these materials

**Welcome!** This workshops is intended to provide learners with a deeper understanding of version control and practical skills to apply version control to their own workflows. Here, we will learn about tools that can help us increase the transparency of our work to ourselves and the people we work with, by tracking the changes we make to our work in a systematic manner. This way, others (and our future selves) can follow the steps  and decision making process. We will also learn how to use tools to facilitate collaboration across different groups and people. 


### Who are these materials for?

The target audience of this workshop is twofold:

- **Self-learners** with no prior experience with version control, who are interested in developing their skills on the topic. You can follow the materials by chronologically going through the slides and following along the practical exercises. You go at your own pace and within your own timeframe. *Speakers notes* will help you to understand and reflect on the content of the materials. Note: Group exercises are *not* possible in this asynchronous setting. 

- **Instructors** in higher education (e.g., universities, colleges) aiming to convey the content of these materials to their learners in a synchronous (in-person, virtual or hybrid) class-room setting. The slides can be directly presented in full screen below, with speaker and instructor notes providing detailed information about the content of the materials and valuable pedagogical tips how to convey the materials to your learners. You can also download the PowerPoint corresponding to the materials below and adapt the materials to your learners. Make sure to give appropriate credit to the original authors.
