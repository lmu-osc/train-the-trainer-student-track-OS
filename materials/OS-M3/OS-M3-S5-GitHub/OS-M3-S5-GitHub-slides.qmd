## General feedback - delete slide 

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Here are my general feedback points/ things I edited: </span>

- Made a separate slide for the licence statement because it was quite a larger slide and placed it as the first slide of the slide deck (beth: okay great)
- As for your question about licensing: I will ask Malika, but my understanding is that if there is an existing MIT license, the original author can re-licence it as CC BY 4.0. People using the content but not owning it can also only reshare it with MIT licence. If the MIT licenced content is part of a larger blob of content with the rest being CC BY 4.0, then it needs to be specified what content is which license. (Beth: so we can leave it stating both the original and CC BY 4.0 then)
- As for the GitHub repo, lets discuss how we can make this sustainable for self-learners, students and instructors? (Beth: Could we copy the files from the repo of the OSC tutorial and put it in a downloadable zip folder? that way self-leanrers (& instructors) can download it + upload it to GitHub to build their own 'project'? I'm thinking of how to make it ready-to-go...)
- QR codes and self - learners: shall we take them out by default? Thoughts? (Beth: Yes adding the QR code would be good and external instructors can just use it for inspo to make their own? I'm thinking about whether they'd have access to the results if they use the survey on the osc account)
- **Consistently add Alt Text to your figures, there is a special option when you insert code for images in Quarto
- I think we need to brainstorm how we design the Github repo PR activity both for instructors and students in class as well as self learners? For the merge changes, for instance - better for a live demo right? Maybe we can make slides for two paths, one for instructors in class and one for slef learners making a PR for their own repo? Thoughts? (Beth: Yes, that was my idea with having the steps on how to merge changes first and then it's followed by a live demonstration. But I can see how to distinguish it more maybe)
- {markdown} is replaced by ```text (Beth: okay)

### Prerequisites

::: {.callout-important}
## Prerequisites

Before completing this submodule, please carefully read about the necessary prerequisites.
:::

<br>

<div style="font-size: 0.5em;"> 
| Prerequisite   |  Description  | Where to find it   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| R and RStudio installed | Latest versions of both R and RStudio |  [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) |
| Basic R skills | 3.2. Introduction to R - Part I |  Module 3.2. |
| Advanced R skills | 3.3. Introduction to R - Part II |  Module 3.3. |
| Basic Git skills | 3.4. Introduction version control (Git) with RStudio |  Module 3.4. |
| GitHub Account | Create a personal account on GitHub | Join at [github.com](github.com) |
| Practice Repository | A practice repository on GitHub used for the practical exercises | See [LMU OSC's repo](https://github.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub) |
</div>

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">So you did not make a new repo..? Or how are we organising this? Are there instructions for the instructor? And what about self learners..? Hmmm </span> Beth: I was hesitant to make a repo because then I would be the owner and then if I change the contents to make an entirely new practice activity, it won't match the images used in the slides. This is why I suggest putting the files from the LMU OSC repo for this tutorial in a folder for the instructors or self-learners to download and build their own repo. 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let us first take a look at these prerequisites. These are important steps to be able to understand what will be covered in this submodule and complete the exercises. 

**Instructor Notes**: These are the prerequisites for this submodule. Before you get started on this submodule with your audience, you need to ensure that the audience fulfills these criteria. In this session, we will assume that your audience has basic R skills and completed the corresponding workshops. We also assume familiarity with Git and that the audience has also completed that submodule. We also assume that, through the previos workshops, participants have downloaded and installed R and RStudio on their local machines. Lastly, the instructor should have created a repository on GitHub with the project files for the students to use for the activities in this session's practical exercises. You may look at the repository used for the LMU OSC Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub for inspiration to create your own project files. 
:::

## Questions from previous submodule

<br>
<br>

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0.1em; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1em; text-align: center;">

Any remaining questions about the most recent content and/or practical exercises?

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Are there any questions from what was discussed during the last session? Are there any remaining thoughts or discussion points?

**Instructor  Notes**:

- Aim: clarify questions from the previous submodule and/or to discuss assignments.

- Additional slides may need to be added depending on the nature of the homework assignments.

- It is critical for the learning process to ensure that students are on the same page and have been able to achieve the learning goals of the previous workshop.

- Not applicable if this set of slides corresponds to the first submodule of a new module.
:::

---

## Before we start: Survey time!

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Add QR code here with note for which survey from the room to pick and probably also that the QR should not be scanned by self learners? </span>
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's start the session by gauging where our Quarto skills are at this point. Please answer honestly and don't worry about having little to no prior knowledge about Quarto. This lesson is for beginners. 

**Instructor Notes**:

- Aim: the pre-submodule survey serves to examine students' prior knowledge about the submodule's topic.

- Use free survey software such as particify to establish this. You can use the example survey, edit it or create your own. Make sure to have a QR code for easy scanning, as well as the link displayed on the slides. 
:::

## Discussion of survey results

<br>

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0.1em; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1em; text-align: center;">

What do we see in the results?

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Looking at the results from this small survey, what can we take from this? There will be a similar post-submodule survey to examine understanding and learning progress.

**Instructor Notes**:

- Aim: briefly examine the answers given to each question interactively with the group.

- Use visuals from the survey to highlight specific answers.

- Make it clear to the group that there will be a similar post-submodule survey to examine understanding and learning progress.
:::

---

## Where are we at?

**Previously**:

-  Basic and advanced R skills (data manipulation, plotting, etc.)
-  Introduction to version control using Git

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
**Up next**:

- Collaborating on projects remotely via GitHub
- Tracking changes of each contributor on GitHub
</div>


<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Unsure if the why github should be here if you also have a slide with that title later?</span> Beth: yea the title is repetitive but this callout is about how GitHub can be used to facilitate Open Science practices
</div>

::: callout-note
## GitHub and Open Science

**GitHub** offers a platform that enables transparent sharing, version control, and reproducible workflows. These are the core pillars of Open Science.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: So far, you have built up your R skills from basic data handling to visualizations and learned the fundamentals of version control with Git. Next, we’re moving into how these tools come together for collaboration such as: working on projects remotely and tracking changes from multiple contributors.

**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- Aim: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context. <br>
- Consider GitHub as a solution to some existing challenges in Open Research to remind students what they are working towards and what the bigger picture is.
:::

---

## Learning goals

At the end of this session, you should be able to:

- **Navigate** GitHub to collaborate on shared projects.
- **Fork** and **clone** repositories to work locally without altering the main branch.
- **Commit**, **push**, and **pull** changes to keep your project tracked and synchronized.
- **Design** a collaborative workflow that enhances the openness and reproducibility of your research.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: By the end of this session, you should feel confident navigating GitHub and using it for collaboration. You’ll learn how to fork and clone repositories to create local copies, commit and push your work, and pull updates from others to stay in sync. Finally, you’ll see how these actions build a workflow that supports open, transparent, and reproducible research.

**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- Aim: Formulate specific, action-oriented goals learning goals which are measurable and observable in line with Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956) <br>
- Emphasis is placed on the VERBS of the learning goals that align with the skills you want to develop or assess.
:::

---

## Covered in this session

<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">

- **GitHub Workflow**
- **Fork a Repo**
- **Clone a Repo**
- **Commit to a Project**
- **Push Changes**
- **Pull Request**
- **Merge Changes**
- **Pull Upstream**

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: This session will be an introduction on how to navigate GitHub and the language (coding) used to communicate with GitHub using your RStudio terminal. What follows are essentially commands you can use to collaborate with others on projects by accessing the files, making changes without affecting anyone else's progress, keeping your work updated, and more. 

**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- Aim: To establish the core theoretical introduction of submodule topics. <br>
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).

## Key terms and definitions

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Hm here, to make it more focused, I would put GitHub back in but remove Git and version control? Perhaps also in the quiz before we can have a quiz question about pushing and pulling since that featured before and students would need to know those two as well before starding with this slide deck? Thoughts? </span> Beth: I can include version control into the definition of git but I would leave it in as a small recap of what git is. 
</div>

- **Git**: A version control system that tracks changes made to files over time.  
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based, online platform that hosts Git-tracked projects. 
- **Git Repository**: (repo) A folder that contains your project files and the history of all changes made to them.
- **GitHub Repository**: An online or remote version of a Git repository that is hosted on GitHub's servers.
- **Branch**: A separate workspace where you can make changes without affecting the main project.


::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: These are some of the key terms that will come up throughout this lesson, let's define them. <br>
- Think of Git is like a time machine for your project as it keeps track of every edit so you can go back to earlier versions or see who changed what. Git runs locally on your computer but connects easily with platforms like GitHub for sharing. <br>
- Version control is the process of tracking and managing updates to your files over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work, making research more organized, transparent, and reproducible. <br>
- A Git repository is a folder that contains your project files and a full history of their changes. This folder can live locally on your computer or online (for example, on GitHub) so others can collaborate. <br>
- A Branch is a copy of your project where you can test changes without affecting the main version. The Main Branch is the stable, official version of your project. You can work on a branch, then merge your updates back into the main branch once they’re reviewed or ready.  

**Instructor Notes**: Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine existing concepts in relation to some key terms. Re-examine formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson. 
:::

## Why GitHub?
  
:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 0.5;"}

![](images/01_GitHub_Logo.png)

:::
::: {style="flex: 1.5;"}

On **GitHub**, you can:

- Host repositories online so teams can work from anywhere.
- Track changes and keep project history.
- Collaborate through branches, commits, and pull requests.
- Promote openness, transparency, and reproducibility in research.

:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: GitHub is a collaborative hub for open and transparent research. It allows teams to host and share repositories online so everyone can contribute from anywhere. Using version control, you can track every change, review project history, and work safely in parallel through branches and pull requests. Ultimately, GitHub supports the core principles of Open Science: openness, transparency, and reproducibility.

**Instructor Notes**: For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, students should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break). <br>
- Aim: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic. <br>
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).
:::

---

## What is collaborative coding? 

**Collaborative coding** is the process of working together on the same code or project (e.g., on GitHub) where everyone can contribute, review, and improve the work collectively.

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 0.5;"}

![](images/02_Collab_Code.png)

:::
::: {style="flex: 1.5;"}

With **collaborative coding**:

- Multiple people can work on different parts of the same project at once.
- Git and GitHub keep everyone’s work organized, merged, and tracked.
- There's more transparency and reproducibility in research projects. 

:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Collaborative coding means that a whole team can contribute to the same project in real time where everyone can edit, review, and improve the same code without overwriting each other’s work. Git and GitHub make this possible by keeping track of every change, merging updates smoothly, and maintaining transparency. This approach makes teamwork easier and strengthens openness and reproducibility in research. <br>
As we go through the different actions you can do with your project files on GitHub, we'll also discuss how it contributes towards a collaborative workflow.
:::

---

## Creating a workflow with GitHub

What a *workflow* using **GitHub** can look like:

![](images/00_GitHub_Workflow.png){fig-align="center"}

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">I wonder if for this slide you could add a pedagogical activity / tool along the lines of "one minute paper" or something similar for students to explain to each other? To the instructor notes I mean? </span> Beth: 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Here’s what a typical workflow using GitHub looks like: <br> 
- Start with a central repository that contains the shared project files. <br>
- Fork the repository to create your own copy on GitHub. <br>
- Clone your fork to your local computer so you can work offline. <br>
- Make changes locally and commit them to track your progress. <br>  
- Push your commits to your fork on GitHub without affecting anyone else’s work. <br>  
- Pull updates from the main branch regularly to keep your copy up to date. <br>  
- When your changes are ready, open a pull request so they can be reviewed and merged into the main branch.  

**Instructor Notes**: Students with no prior knowledge in GitHub may not know what any of these terms mean but this is a helpful introduction to how the different actions on GitHub come together to create a workflow and would help students make the connection between them as they follow along in this session to learn them. This image will be shown again at the end so students can have a chance to view the diagram with a clearer understanding of what the terms mean. 
:::

---

## Fork a repo

To **fork a repo** means to copy a collaborator’s repo to your own remote *GitHub account*.

- Enables multiple contributors to work in parallel.
- Make changes without affecting the original project.
- Provides a personal workspace to test ideas.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now let's go through each of the steps in the workflow and practice them. The first step is to make your own copy of the project repository to your GitHub account. To do this, you need to fork the repo, which means to copy it so that you have your own version where you can host your changes to send it with changes back to the main repository later. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? It enables multiple contributors to work on the project at the same time. The changes you make on your copy won't affect the original project, so it becomes your personal workspace where you can freely test ideas ideas.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 1: Forkc a repo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/fork-button.png)

- [ ] Go to the repo on GitHub 
- [ ] Click on "`Fork`" in the top-right toolbar

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Go to the main repository of the project we will be using for today. Find the toolbar at the top that is next to the name of the repository and click "Fork". 

**Instructor Notes**: Provide students with the name or link to the repo created for this session. 

:::

---

## Practical exercise 1: Fork a repo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/create-fork.png){width="70%"}

- [ ] Click on the green "`Create fork`" button at the bottom-right of the screen

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: It takes you to a new page where we will leave the default settings and just click the green "Create fork" button at the bottom. 

**Instructor Notes**:
:::

---

## Fork a repo

You will see the fork of the repository on your GitHub account.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/fork-process.png)

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: When you click on the drop-down arrow next to "Fork" on the main repository, you will see your fork of the repository. 

**Instructor Notes**: 
:::

---

## Clone a repo

To **clone a repo** means to copy the project files onto your *local device*, such as your personal computer.

- Connects your local work directly to the team’s online repository.
- Makes it easy to sync updates between contributors.

::: callout-important
## Important Difference

When you **fork** the repo, a copy is made on your *remote GitHub account*. When you **clone** a repo, a copy is downloaded from GitHub onto your *local device*.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To work on your copy or version of the project, clone it to your personal device. When you clone the repo, it takes the project from GitHub and downloads it onto your personal device so now you would have an offline version of the project to work on. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? You can now have a copy of the project files on your local device that's still connected to the online repository and it makes it easy to sync updates between contributors.

**Instructor Notes**: Both forking and cloning involve making copies of the repo but to different locations, so make this distinction clear. If there is any confusion, you can go back to the first diagram of the workflow to visualize the difference. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 2: Clone a repo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/clone-button.png){width="60%"}

- [ ] Click on the green `<> Code` button
- [ ] Click on the `SSH` tab to get the URL
- [ ] Copy the repository's URL

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's practice this using the same test-repository. Now we are in our fork and need to find the green "Code button". Once you find that, it will most likely be on the HTTPS tab so we need to click on the SSH tab and copy the URL given there. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 2: Clone a repo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/new-project.png){width="70%"}

- [ ] In **RStudio**, click File -> New Project to open a new project

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now you need to open RStudio and open a new project by selecting "New Project" under the File menu.

::: callout-important
## New Folder

Locate this Git repository in a new folder on your device so that each folder has its own Git database.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Remember the URL we copied from the SSH tab? Now we need to paste it under "Repository URL". If you've created a folder with a Git database for a previous lesson, make a new one for this. Each folder should have it's own Git database. When you hit "Create Project" you'll need to enter your password.

**Instructor Notes**: If students are confused as to which password is required- it's the password for their individual GitHub accounts.
:::

---

## Clone a repo

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/files-tab.png)

Now, when you click on the `Files` tab in **RStudio**, you should see all the files from the GitHub repository that you cloned. 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: And that's it! You should now have the files of the project on your local device. Check this by clicking on the "Files" tab in RStudio and see that all the files from the project that's on the GitHub repository is now showing up. 
:::

---

## Commit to a project

To **commit to a project** means to save the file with the changes you made locally in your version control system.

- Records progress in small and trackable steps
- Lets others see exactly what was changed
- Makes it possible to revert or review changes if there are bugs

::: callout-tip
## Avoiding Conflicts

Commits help with resolving conflicts because they create clear checkpoints in your project’s history. GitHub also offers [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues) as a communication tool to resolve conflicts. 
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project after you make changes. Each commit records what was changed, when, and by whom. You usually include a short message describing the update, for example, “Updated code for analysis," and saves it in Git's version history. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? Frequent commits records the progress of each contributor in small, trackable steps. It let's others see what changes had been made. Frequent commits also make it possible to review changes if something breaks because now you can go back, review changes, and isolate problems to fix it. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 3: Commit

Before you **commit to a project**, you need to make some changes to the project.

I don't want to say the "params_tmpl.R" file and then they are using something else. I said "specified" so that the instructor would specify which file will be used but I see how this would not work for self-learners. Back to the idea to put the project files in a downloadable folder, I could specify that they select the "params_tmpl.R" then. 
</div>

- [ ] Select the specified file
- [ ] Click `More`,  then `Copy...` to make a copy of this file

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: We're still in RStudio. Click on the drop-down arrow by "More" and click "Copy". 

**Instructor Notes**: Copying the file and then editing the copied file is specific to this practice exercise. You do not always need to copy the file to then make changes to it, a project can require a contributor to make changes to the file directly. It depends on the project. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 3: Commit

- [ ] Enter a name for your copied file 

![This is an example of a name for the copied file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/rename-copy.png)

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Maybe with an example? </span> Beth: added.
</div>

- [ ] Make changes to your copied file according to the instructions

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: You'll be prompted to give the copied file a name/title, use something identifiable like including your first name. Then, open the copied file and follow the instructions to make the necessary changes. 

**Instructor Notes**: Make sure the instructions for what to do in the file are clearly written. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 3: Commit

- [ ] Save your file by going to `File` -> `Save` 
<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">more instructions on how to save or not needed? </span> Yes, added. 
</div>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/stage.png){fig-align="center"}

- [ ] In the `Git` tab, tick the box next to *your copied file* to **stage** your file
- [ ] Click `Commit` 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: After this, save the file as normal by going to "File" and then clicking "Save". In the Git tab on RStudio, click the checkbox next to your copied file under the "Staged" column. Then click the "Commit" button. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 3: Commit

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/commit.png){fig-align="center"}

- [ ] Add a comment in the "Commit message" box briefly describing the changes you made (for example: "add Malika rocks parameters" <div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Maybe an example here? </span> Yes, an example is in the image but I can also include it in the instruction. 
</div>
- [ ] Click `Commit`

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: You should leave a message for your commit. This is like describing the changes you made to make your commits more informative. For example, just state what you added to the file. Click the "Commit" button. 
:::

---

## Push changes

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">I think I would find it useful there to have a brief recap + pedagogical activity in the instructor notes? What do you think? Or maybe after concluding this step? </span> Beth: then I like the idea of the One-Minute Paper activity coming here to do a recap.  
</div>

To **push changes** means to upload your local commits from your local computer to the remote repository on GitHub.

- Keeps the online version of the project up to date.
- Makes your work visible to all contributors in real time.
- Enables others to pull your latest edits and build on them.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: The next step after making your changes and committing them is to push the changes you made from your local device onto the remote forked repository that is on your GitHub account. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? It keeps the online version of the project up to date with all the changes made and makes it visible to all the contributors. It also enables others working on the project to take your edits and build on them.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 4: Push

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/push-rstudio.png){fig-align="center"}

- [ ] In the `Git` tab, click `Push` to push your changes to GitHub
- [ ] Enter your password when prompted

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To push the changes you just made to the file on your local device to your online fork on GitHub, you need to click the "Push" button in the Git tab. You'll then need to enter your password again. 
:::

---

## Push changes

If you successfully pushed your changes, you would see a pop up box like the one below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/push-github.png){fig-align="center"}

You should see your new file and your commit message next to it in the GitHub repository when you refresh the page. <div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">mention the commit message as well? </span> Beth: added
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: If all went well, you will see a pop up box with a message like this one to let you know the changes were successfully pushed to the remote repository. An additional way to make sure your changes were pushed, refresh your GitHub repository webpage and check to see if the file you copied is now appearing.
:::

---

## Pre-break survey


::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Before the break, let's take a moment to review the things we covered in the first part of this lesson. This survey has a few simple recap questions about what we’ve learned so far about using GitHub for collaboration on projects. The goal isn’t to test you, but to help you reflect on what you’ve learned and to see if anything needs a bit more clarification.

**Instructor Notes**: It's important to have an idea of these key terms because they will reappear many times throughout the rest of this lesson. <br>
- Aim: This pre-break survey serves to examine students' current understanding of key concepts of the submodule. <br>
- Use free survey software such as  or other survey software (particify, formR) to establish the following questions (shown on separate slides)
:::

---

**What is GitHub mainly used for?**

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">Eliminate the green tick and descrbie the correct answer in the instructor notes? </span>
</div>

a. Editing photos online

b. Hosting and collaborating on code or research projects ✅

c. Sending emails to developers

d. Backing up personal files only

---

**What happens when you fork a repository?**

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">rephrased the questions a little - thoughts? </span>
</div>

a. You delete the original repository

b. You download a copy of the remote repository to your local computer

c. You create your own remote copy of someone else’s repository on GitHub ✅

d. You merge your work into the main branch

---

**What does it mean to clone a repository?**

a. You download the repository from GitHub to your local device ✅

b. You create a backup of your GitHub account

c. You make your repository private

## Post-break survey discussion

<br>

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0.1em; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1em; text-align: center;">

What do we see in the results?

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's discuss the survey answers and clarify any questions before moving on to the next section.

**Instructor Notes** <br>
- Aim: To clarify concepts and aspects that are not yet understood
- Highlight specific answers given during the survey
- Also, use this time to clarify any confusions or questions on specific topics students may have from the first part of the session.
:::

---

## Pull request

To make a **pull request** means to ask for your changes (from your fork or branch) to be reviewed and merged into the main project.

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">I am unsure about the working of main project here - what do you think? </span>
</div>

- Creates a space for discussion and code review before incorporating changes.
- Encourages feedback and peer learning
- Maintains project quality and consistency.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: After pushing your changes to your remote repository, it's just on your forked copy and not in the main project. You then need to make a pull request which is a request on GitHub for the changes you pushed to be reviewed and then incorporated or merged into the main project. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? The changes can be reviewed and checked for error before making it a part of the main project. This allows for feedback, peer learning, and maintains levels of quality and consistency across the project files. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 5: Pull request

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/pull-request-button.png)

- [ ] On your **GitHub repository**, click on `Contribute`
- [ ] Click on the green `Open pull request` button

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now we're working in the remote repository on GitHub. In your fork, click on "Contribute" and then the green "Open pull request" button. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 5: Pull request

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/create-pull-request.png)

- [ ] Ensure the *base repository* is the original one and the *head repository* is your fork
- [ ] Ensure your requested merge does not create any conflict (you will see a green "`✓ Able to merge`")

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Check the settings to ensure the "base repository" is the original repository and the "head repository" is your fork. You should see a message in green saying "Able to merge" and this means that the request to merge does not create any conflict.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 5: Pull request

- [ ] Add a title and a message describing your contributions/changes made
- [ ] Click `Create pull request`

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/created-pull-request.png)

- You should see a conversation tab around your pull request in the original repository.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Add a message describing the changes you made. Again, you can just state what you added. Now click "Create pull request". In the original repository, you should now see a conversation tab around the "Pull request" button.
:::

---

## Merge changes

To **merge changes** means to combine updates from different branches or contributors into one unified version of the project.

- Brings everyone’s contributions together.
- Ensures new work integrates smoothly with the main branch.
- Helps resolve overlapping edits or conflicts between files.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now that the changes have been made and you opened a pull request, the next step is for those changes to be reviewed and incorporated into the main branch. This is what is meant by "merge" because the contributions from the different collaborators are merged into the one project that everyone is working on. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? This brings the contributions together in one place, ensures new work integrates smoothly with the main branch, and will make overlapping edits or conflicts between files visible so you can go in and resolve them. 
:::

## How to merge changes

:::::: columns
::: column

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/files-changed.png)

:::
::: column

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">maybe emphasise here or with a call out box what is being merged into what in this specific example?</span>
</div>

The owner of the repository will: 

- Go to their `Pull requests` tab to inspect the changed files 
- Ensure that the parameters were inputted correctly so as to not break down their code down the line

:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now we will have a live demonstration of how these pull requests are merged into the main repository. First, click on the "Pull requests" tab and inspect the files there. Take one and check that everything was done correctly so it's ready to merge. 

**Instructor Notes**: First go through the slides of this section to see how to merge changes, then do a live demonstration using the changes they made to the Example Project. For this session, the instructor created the GitHub repository and therefore is the one to review and merge the changes. But it is still important for the students to learn HOW to merge changes for when they begin projects of their own.
:::

---

## How to merge changes

:::::: columns
::: column

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/comment-and-merge.png)

:::
::: column

If everything looks fine, the owner will: 

- Go back to the `Pull request` tab
- Write a comment
- Merge the **pull request** and **confirm the merge**

:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: If everything looks fine, go back to the "Pull request" tab, leave a comment (this is optional), and click on "Merge pull request" then "Confirm the merge". And now that file that was inspected is now incorporated into the project files in main repository.
:::

---

## Merge changes

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">I like this one as a feature, but here I think we need to design it so that both instructors could use it in class AND self learners could easily make their own PR and merge? </span>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0.1em; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1em; text-align: center;">

Now let's see what that looks like for this project with a **live demonstration** using your contributions!

</div>


::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now that we know what to do, let's see it in action with a live demonstration! We will merge changes in one or more forks with the main repository project files via the pull requests. 

**Instructor Notes**: Do a live demonstration of merging some changes- depending on the size of the class, it may be too time-consuming to review and merge the changes from each individual student.
:::

---

## Pull upstream

To **pull upstream** means to update your local or forked repository with the latest changes from the original (upstream) repository.

- Keeps your local copy aligned with the main project’s progress.
- Prevents outdated or conflicting edits when working in teams.
- Encourages synchronization across all contributors.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Even after you pushed your changes and it was merged into the main branch, the project may still be ongoing or your local and remote copied repositories may not have the contributions from the other collaborators. This is why you should pull upstream to update your local or forked repository with the latest changes from the original repo. <br>
How does this contribute towards collaboration? Keeps your local copy updated with the changes in the main project, prevents outdated or conflicting edits, and synchronizes work across each contributor.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 6: Pull upstream

- [ ] In **RStudio**, go to the `Terminal` tab
- [ ] Enter the following command: 

```text
git checkout main
```

<br>

::: callout-note
## `git checkout`

This command sets the branch to the one you want to pull the modifications from. In this case, you want to pull the changes from the *main branch* of the *original repo* onto your *local copy*. 
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To pull upstream repository into your fork, you need to pull the original repository directly into your local repository, not to your remote fork. When the changes are pulled into your local copy, then you could push the changes to your remote fork. <br>
To do this, we go back into RStudio and go to the "Terminal" tab. Enter the given git command. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 6: Pull upstream

- [ ] In the RStudio **Terminal**, enter the command to pull the original repo and branch following this format, replacing the original owner and original repository<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">with? I maybe see potential for difficulties here? </span>
</div>:

```text 
git pull git@github.com:ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
```

![This is an example.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/command-line.png)
<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">align the caption in the center? </span>
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Next, we type this command to pull the original repository and branch we wish to obtain locally. Follow the format but replace "ORIGINAL_OWNER" and "ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY". Here's an example of what it looks like when these two commands are executed successfully.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 6: Pull upstream

- [ ] In **RStudio**, check the `Files` tab to make sure the new contributions <div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;"> which ones (here I think it is worth being very specific?) </span>
</div> are showing up
- [ ] To push this <div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">which? </span>
</div>into your remote fork on **GitHub**, you can also do so by entering the following command into the terminal:

```text
git push
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/main/assets/final-push.png)

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: The files that you pulled from the original repository should now be showing up in your "File" tab in RStudio, this means that they are now on your local copy. To also have them appear on your fork on GitHub you can push them using a simple Git command: git push. Enter this into the terminal to execute it.

## Recap 

**What did we learn in today's lesson?**

- **Fork a repo**: make your own copy on GitHub
- **Clone the repo**: bring it to your local computer
- **Commit**: make changes locally
- **Push**: upload those changes to your fork on GitHub
- **Pull request**: propose those changes to the main/original repo
- **Merge**: the project owner merges your pull request into the main branch
- **Pull upstream**: after the merge, you pull the updated main branch from the original repo to sync your local copy

---

## Recap Activity

Remember this illustration?

![](images/03_Recap_Activity.png){fig-align="center"}

## Collaborative coding with GitHub

**How can collaborative coding with GitHub be useful?**

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">
<span style="color:red;">convert into pedagogical activity with instructions in instructor notes and just leaving the question on its own on the slide before giving the "answers" the slide after= </span>
</div>

- Track changes, isolate mistakes, and review project history with **version control**.
- Multiple contributors can **collaborate** on a project without conflicts.
- Have a local copy of the project so it remains **accessible** from anywhere.
- Shared repositories ensure that analyses, code, and results are **reproducible** and **transparent**.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Some of the ways collaborative coding using GitHub is useful. <br>
- Version control means every change is tracked, so mistakes can be undone easily. <br>
- It allows multiple people to work on the same project at once, even from different locations, without overwriting each other’s work.<br>
- By sharing code through repositories, others can reproduce your analyses and see exactly how results were produced. This strengthens both collaboration and scientific transparency.

**Instructor Notes**: The aim of this slide is to work out the relevance of the topic to your students. In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be applied in practise with specific examples. Examine downfalls and practical obstacles.
:::

---

## Take-home message

<br>
<br>

Consider the following question:

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0.1em; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 0.7em;">
If you had to explain to a new teammate why using GitHub for collaboration is valuable, what key ideas from today would you talk about?
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes:** Let's think about a take-home message from today's lesson. Take a few moments and consider the question on the slide and then let's discuss it. 
:::

---

## Assignment UNFINISHED

- **Aim**: Explain the homework assignment and the rationale behind the homework.
- Examine whether/how it will be assessed
- Mention scoring rubrics, if applicable
- Design a peer-review system for assignments to place students in role of reviewer and author

---

## To conclude: Survey time!

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To end this lesson, let's use this survey to see where we stand in our understanding of using GitHub and what we can focus on more moving forward to become more proficient in using it for collaborative work. 

*Instructor Notes* <br>
- Aim: This post-submodule survey serves to examine students' current knowledge about the sumodule's topic. <br>
- Use free survey software such as or other survey software (particify, formR) to establish the following questions (these are examples that can be adapted to suit your needs):
:::

---

**Which of the following concepts or skills do you feel MOST confident about in relation to Git and GitHub? (Select all that apply)**

a. Forking a repository and working on my own copy.

b. Cloning a repository from GitHub to my local machine.

c. Making commits and writing meaningful commit messages.

d. Pushing local changes to a remote repository.

e. Pulling or fetching updates from a remote repository.

g. I am still not sure about any of these concepts.

---

**On a scale of 1 to 5, how comfortable are you right now with using Git and GitHub for collaborative coding and version control? (1 = Not comfortable at all, 5 = Very comfortable)**

a. 1

b. 2

c. 3

d. 4

e. 5

---

**When you worked collaboratively on this GitHub project, what aspect did you find most challenging?**

a. Understanding Git commands (commit, push, pull).

b. Remembering all the steps.

c. Navigating the GitHub interface.

d. Other

## Discussion of survey results

<br>

<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0.1em; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1em; text-align: center;">

What do we see in the results and how do they compare to the previous ratings?

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now that you've completed both the pre- and post-module survey, let's compare the results to see where we began and how we've made progress. This is also a good time to raise any concerns or clarify any concepts you may not have understood fully.

**Instructor Notes**: Aim: Briefly examine the answers given to each question interactively with the group. Compare and highlight specific differences in answers between pre- and post-survey answers
