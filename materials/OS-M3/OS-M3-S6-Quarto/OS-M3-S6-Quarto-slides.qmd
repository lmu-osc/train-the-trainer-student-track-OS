<div style="font-size: 0.6em;">
<span style="color:red">From SvG: <br>
- Changed around the contribution and credit statement
- Something to check: are the QR codes stable? Some generators do not allow for the QR code to be active for longer than X amount of time - so will the QR code link out to particify? On the other hand, particify rooms stay indefinitely, so that is nice! </span>
</div>

Changes made during final review

- Updated format of the slides to match more recent slide decks
- Changed the "So, Why Quarto" slides (lines 314- )
- Added alt text to all images
- Expanded Exercise 1,
- Removed 'adding columns' + Exercise 8 from Additional Authoring Features and included it in the homework activity 
- Rearranged the order of activities in the homework to improve the flow
**********- Added to the cheatsheet the functions introduced in the homework activity (headings, themes, tables, columns, computed values)

## Setting up Quarto

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;"> 
During this session, we will be using Quarto from RStudio. To set up Quarto, follow these steps:

1. Open RStudio
2. Install the most recent version of Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/download/release.html)
3. In RStudio, go to the Terminal tab and install [tinytex](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html#installing-tex) by typing `quarto install tinytex` into your terminal
4. Type `quarto --version` into the terminal to check with version of Quarto you are using (should be 1.7 or higher)
</div>

::: {.callout-important}
Make sure to have a recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (Version 4.4.3 or higher ) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (Version 2025.05.1+513 or higher) installed before you install/update Quarto. For installing R and RStudio, see [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: During this session, we will be using Quarto from RStudio. It is therefore necessary for you to have the most recent version of R and RStudio installed. Then open RStudio and install Quarto following the link. Finally, install tinytex, which is a small version of TeX that can be used to build pdf documents with Quarto. You need to install tinytex from the Terminal within RStudio by typing `quarto install tinytex` into the terminal. 

**Instructor Notes**: Leave enough time for the download and installation of Quarto. Guide your students through the installation of tinytex by showing them where to find the Terminal in RStudio. To see which version of Quarto they already have installed, students can type `quarto --version` into the terminal. Quarto versions of 1.7 or higher are suitable for the rest of this tutorial. Quarto may fail or behave unpredictably with older versions of R and RStudio, as newer Quarto features and extensions rely on recent R releases and the current RStudio. Keeping both up to date helps to avoid errors.
:::

## Questions from previous submodule?

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Are there any questions from what we discussed during the last session? Are there any remaining thoughts or discussion points?

**Instructor  Notes**: <br>
- Aim: clarify questions from the previous submodule and/or to discuss assignments.
- Additional slides may need to be added depending on the nature of the homework assignments.
- It is critical for the learning process to ensure that students are on the same page and have been able to achieve the learning goals of the previous workshop.
- Not applicable if this set of slides corresponds to the first submodule of a new module.

## Quarto and Open Science

**Quarto** is a tool that can help us connect ideas, data, and people through open and reproducible research.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Previously, you have gained skills and experience with R, RStudio, version control with Git, and collaborative work on GitHub. Next, we are moving to a new tool: Quarto. Here, you will learn about a platform that can combine text, code, and media all into one document. We will cover how to create a simple website using different functionalities that Quarto offers.

**Instructor Notes**: Aim: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context. Consider Quarto as a solution to some existing challenges in Open Research to remind learners what they are working towards and what the bigger picture is.
:::

## Session learning goals

At the end of this session, you should be able to:

- **Create**, **edit**, and **render** Quarto documents
- **Use key Quarto features** like code chunks, YAML headers, citations, and output formatting
- **Insert citations** and **generate a bibliography** with Zotero directly into the Quarto document
- **Publish** and **share** your work using GitHub Pages 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: These are the goals we’re working toward in today’s session. By the end, you should be comfortable creating, editing, and rendering Quarto documents. You’ll also know how to use key features like code chunks, YAML headers, citations, and formatting. <br>
- We’ll practice inserting citations and generating bibliographies using Zotero, and finally, we’ll publish and share our work using GitHub Pages. <br>
- Think of this as the full workflow: first is authoring the document, then comes proper referencing, and finally sharing your work openly.

**Instructor Notes**: Aim- Formulate specific, action-oriented goals learning goals which are measurable and observable in line with Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956) <br>
- Emphasis is placed on the **verbs** of the learning goals- choose verbs that align with the skills you want to develop or assess.
:::

## Covered in this session

<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">

- **Key Terms and Definitions**: Understanding core concepts in Quarto
- **Setting up Quarto**: Opening a Quarto document in RStudio
- **Authoring**: Writing text and structuring content
- **Code Chunks**: Running and displaying code
- **Additional Authoring Features**: Using images, links, and columns
- **Citations**: Adding citations and bibliography with Zotero
- **Publishing**: Sharing your Quarto document to GitHub

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: This session will cover some basics in how to use Quarto and then some ways it can work with other platforms to perform functions like referencing and publishing. We will first begin by setting up a Quarto document in RStudio, then we will look at important elements: text, code, media, links, and layout. Next, we will work with both Quarto and Zotero for quick and easy citations and, finally, we will look at sharing our work to GitHub. All of these are pertinent steps in learning how to use Quarto to facilitate Open Research practices

**Instructor Notes**: Aim: To establish the core theoretical introduction of submodule topics. <br>
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980). <br>
- For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, learners should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break).

:::

---

## Key terms and definitions

- **.qmd file** 
- **YAML header**
- **Code chunks**
- **Quarto markdown text**

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: These are some of the key terms that will come up throughout this lesson. What are your associations with each of these concepts? Which ones have you come across before? What could these concepts refer to? What is new to you?
  
**Instructor Notes**: Use the think-pair-share paradigm to examine existing concepts and definitions. learners think for themselves what they associate with each term, discuss collaboratively in pairs and then share their thoughts with the group. 
:::

---

## Key terms and definitions

::: incremental
- **.qmd file**: The type of file the Quarto document is saved as. 
- **YAML header**: The section at the top of the Quarto document that controls settings like the title, output format, and author.
- **Code chunks**: The sections of the document that contain code (from R or Python, for example) that are used for showing results such as tables, plots, or calculations.
- **Quarto markdown text**: This combines text, codes, and formatting to create the actual content of the document.
- The YAML header, code chunks, and markdown text are the *components of the .qmd file*.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: A Quarto document or file gets the extension of .qmd. The YAML header is the section at the top of the Quarto document that controls settings like the title, output format, and author. The code chunks are the sections of the document that contain code (from R or Python, for example) that are used for showing results such as tables, plots, or calculations. Then, the Quarto markdown text is the component that combines text, codes, and formatting to create the actual content of the document. These are different components within a Quarto document that are important for rendering.  

**Instructor Notes**: Aim: Introduce key terms and definitions that students will come across throughout the session. <br>
- This first part of the lesson is useful to establish an understanding of important vocabulary- it can be helpful to remind students of the meaning of these terms as they appear in the upcoming sections. <br>
- Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine existing concepts in relation to some key terms. Re-examine formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson.

## What is Quarto?

An **open-source scientific and publishing system** that combines text, code and media to produce transparent and reproducible work that can be freely accessed by others.

With Quarto, you can easily: 

- **Analyze** data, text, or research content
- **Share** results and outputs like reports, slides, or websites
- **Reproduce** entire workflows

:::callout-note
## Quarto Website
You can always check out the [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/) to learn more.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Quarto is an open-source publishing system, this means it is free to use and community-driven. Anyone can download it, contribute towards its improvement, and adapt it. It's designed for combining text, code, and media in a way that makes your work transparent and reprodcible, this means that anyone can read it, rerun the code, and even check the results themselves. <br>
- The 3 key things you can do with Quarto are: <br>
  - Analyze and work with data, text, or research content directly in your document <br>
  - Share or present your results as reports, slides, or even full websites <br>
  - Make your workflow reproducible so others can repeat them. 
  
**Instructor Notes**: Establishing a clear idea of what Quarto is at the beginning of the lesson is useful for building context and purpose. <br>
- Context: how all the parts of Quarto work together to create the intended document(s) <br>
- Purpose: reasons why one would use Quarto (it's versatile, customizable, and shareable)
:::

## So, why Quarto?

1. **Readability**: 

<div style="font-size: .6em;">

Which side is easier to read? 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
*Side A*

`````{markdown}
With **Quarto**, one can combine the following 
into *one single document*:

- text 
- code
- media

```r
1 + 1
2 + 2
```
`````
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
*Side B*

With **Quarto**, one can combine the following into *one single document*:

- text 
- code
- media


```{r}
1 + 1
2 + 2
```
:::
::::::
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's first answer the question, "How can using Quarto solve common challenges in research?" Research can be messy and scattered sometimes, especially when you want to use different elements like text, code, and media. This is where Quarto comes in! It brings these elements together where we can type, run code, embed media, and cite literature all in one place. 

**Instructor Notes**: 
:::

---

## So, why Quarto?

**Reproducibility**:

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: This can also be an obstacle when sharing and ensuring your work is reproducible. It also allows for different ways to share and ensure our research is transparent and reproducible. So this lesson is just part of a bigger journey in integrating Open Research practices in our work. 
:::

---

## "Rendering in Quarto"

What is **rendering**? The process where Quarto runs the code, combines it with the text, and creates a final output.

- There are two ways to render in Quarto:

  - **Render on Save**: Quarto will automatically re-render the document each time you click "Save"
  - **Manual Rendering**: You have to click on the "Render" each time you want to see the output

![You can find both *Render on Save* and *Manual Render* at the top of your workspace](images/01_Render.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a menu bar in an RStudio workspace with red rectangles highlighting the 'Render on Save' checkbox and 'Render' button."}

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Quarto documents can be rendered either manually or automatically when you save your work. <br>
- Manual rendering gives you control meaning you decide when to update the document. This is helpful if you’re making lots of edits and don’t want constant re-renders. <br>
- Render on Save automatically updates your document every time you hit Save, which is great for quick feedback and seeing your changes instantly. In this lesson, you can try both to see which workflow feels more comfortable for you.

**Instructor Notes**: It can be more helpful for new learners getting started with Quarto to have the 'Render on Save' option active. Keep the rendered window (the browser with the rendered version of the website) open as well so that they can simply hit save when they make changes and have it rendered automatically to view the changes in real time. 
:::

---

## Quarto modes

You can write Quarto documents in **Source mode** or **Visual mode** in RStudio.

- **Source mode** allows you write directly in plain text/Markdown Syntax, allowing for more control and it's closer to raw code

- **Visual mode** gives a WYSIWYM-style interface which is easier for beginners, but sometimes hides syntax.

This is part of the **authoring process**, and it allows you to format the text, add code, and build your document.


::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Quarto documents can be created and edited in either Source mode or Visual mode. Both modes work with the same file, but they provide slightly different experiences. Source Mode is like writing in raw code as you write in plain text or Markdown syntax. Visual Mode shows the formatted text, headings, tables, and the like as they would appear in the final output. WYSIWYM is an acronym for "What You Say is What You Mean" which means that whatever you see in your document will be what you see even when you save or render the document as PDF or as HTML. <br>
- In this lesson, most of our tasks will be done in Source mode, but you’ll also have a chance to try Visual mode so you can compare how the same content looks and feels in each. <br>
- This is part of the authoring process where you are creating the content of the document.

**Instructor Notes**: "Authoring process" is mentioned here but not defined because it will be explained further in later slides. <br>
- Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine existing concepts in relation to some key terms. You can re-examine formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson.

## Creating a Quarto document

These are the steps to open a Quarto Document in RStudio:

:::::: columns
::: column
![](images/02_Quarto_Setup.png){fig-alt="An image of the drop-down menu in RStudio's File tab highlighting the 'New File' option and then the selection of the 'Quarto Document' option."}
:::
::: column
-   Select "`File`"\
-   → Select "`New File`"\
-   → Select "`Quarto Document`"
:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To get started with Quarto in RStudio, the first step is to create a new Quarto document. You do this by going to 'File' on the toolbar and selecting 'New File'. Here, you see options for both Quarto Document and Quarto Presentation. <br>
- What's the difference between the two? A Quarto Document is best for reports or articles because it produces continuous text like a paper. A Quarto Presentation is for creating slide decks, like PowerPoint or Reveal.js slides. For the exercises today, we will select 'Quarto Document'.

**Instructor Notes**: This lesson intentionally starts with a standalone Quarto document rather than an R Project. While Quarto documents can be used inside R Projects, avoiding project setup at this stage reduces complexity and allows learners to focus on the core ideas of Quarto before introducing project-based workflows.
:::

---

## Setting up Quarto document

:::::: columns
::: column
![](images/03_Quarto_Setup.png){fig-alt="This image shows the setup screen when creating a New Quarto Document for actions such as setting the title, author, and output format."}
:::
::: column

- You can set some of the YAML header details here like the title and output format (the default format is html)
- → Hit "`Create`"

:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: This creates your document where you can now customize the YAML header, add Markdown text, and insert code chunks. The default format is html but this can be changed later on by editing the YAML header directly in the document. When you press 'Create', it will open your Quarto document in RStudio where you can begin building your document
:::

---

## Practical exercise 1

-   [ ] Create a new folder on your device
-   [ ] Repeat the steps in the previous slides to create a new Quarto Document
-   [ ] Set the title as "Chicken Weights"
-   [ ] Use your name for the author
-   [ ] Select 'File' → 'Save As...' and save this Quarto Document in the folder you created 

::: callout-tip
## Why make a New Folder?

Creating a folder on your device helps you stay organized! Keeping all the files (such as Quarto documents and images) makes it easier for you to store and retrieve all materials related to the project or exercise. 
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: We will create a Quarto document using these steps. But first, make a new folder on your device to make it easier for you to store and retrieve files related to the activities today. Then, follow the steps from the previous slide and make a new Quarto document in RStudio. Name the document "Chicken Weights" and put your own name as the author of the document. Then, save this document in the folder that you created.

**Instructor Notes**: Ensure students know where this new folder for the Quarto exercises is located on their device, suggest that they simply right-click on their desktop or 'Documents' folder and click 'New' → 'Folder' so as not to complicate this initial process. This will make it easier for them to find files in later tasks. Then, after creating the Quarto Document, encourage them to save the document right after by selecting "Save As", so they can manually choose the document location (for example, on the Desktop or in a newly created course folder).
:::

---

## Authoring a Quarto document

What is **authoring**? 

- The process of writing and structuring the Quarto document.

- Consider it as a formula: **Authoring = YAML Header + Markdown**

To practice authoring in Quarto, let's start with setting the YAML header and adding markdown text in **Source mode**.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Authoring is combining the YAML header with the markdown text. This means that what you do to customize, add to, and develop your document is the process of 'authoring.' <br>
- The YAML header is the section at the very top, wrapped in three dashes (---). It holds the document’s settings, like the title, author, date, and output format. <br>
- Below that, we use Markdown text to write the actual content which are things like headings, bullet points, bold or italic text, and the actual body of your document. 

**Instructor Notes**: Reminding students of the meanings of YAML Header and Markdown text will be helpful especially to those with very little prior knowledge as these are terms that appear very often when working with Quarto. 
:::

---

## Practical exericise 2

-   [ ] Copy and paste the following into the YAML Header of your document

``` yaml
---
title: "ChickWeight Analysis"
author: "Your Name"
format:
  html:
    code-fold: false
    toc: true
---
```
::: callout-note
## Output format

In future projects, you can replace "html" to render the document to a different format.

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html" target="_blank">link to a list of the different output formats</a>.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Remember that the YAML Header goes at the top of the document in both Source and Visual Modes. In the YAML header, the format field tells Quarto what kind of output to create. Here we’ve set it to html, which means the document will render as a web page. You could choose other formats like PDF or Word, but for this lesson we’ll stick with HTML so everyone has the same experience. 

**Instructor Notes**: There is a small clipboard icon at the top-right of the text box. Let students know they can simply click the icon to copy all the text in that specific text box. This icon will appear for every text box moving forward so you can remind them of it the next few times a task requires them to copy the content of a text box.
:::

---

## Authoring: Text formatting

**Basic Markdown Text Formatting**

-   **Bold:** `**bold**` → **bold**

-   *Italic:* `*italic*` → *italic*

-   ~~Strikethrough:~~ `~~text~~` → ~~text~~

-   `Inline code:` `` `code` `` → `code`

::: callout-note
## Markdown text shortcuts

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/options.html">link for the full list of markdown text shortcuts</a> for formatting!
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: With Markdown text, we can format text with very simple symbols. It works the same way in both Source and Visual mode with the only difference being how you see it while typing. In Source mode you see the symbols, while in Visual mode it looks like regular bold or italic text right away.
:::

---

## Authoring: Markdown text

<br>

``` markdown
Have you ever wondered what affects a chick's weight? 
This document explores the ChickWeight dataset using R.  
The goal is to compare chick weight across different diets and time points.  
Key steps include:

- Loading the dataset  
- Visualizing growth trends  
- Summarizing results
```

<br>

This is an example of **markdown text**. Let's use it to continue authoring and building our document. 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: The words "Markdown Text" may seem technical or complicated for those new to Quarto. But Markdown text can simply be understood as just typing, like writing in any normal document, sometimes with a few simple symbols to add structure or emphasis. 

**Instructor Notes**: The aim here is to help students feel comfortable using Markdown text by showing how simple and familiar it really is.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 3

-   [ ] Copy the markdown text from the previous slide and paste it to your document
-   [ ] Bold the word *"ChickWeight"*
-   [ ] Italicize the phrase *"growth trends"*

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To practice formatting the Markdown text, let's copy the text from the previous slide and use simple keyboard shortcuts to bold and italicize certain parts. 

**Instructor Notes**: It's useful to render the document after each practical exercise (where applicable) so students can see the changes as they make them and identify issues. If the 'Render on Save' is active, just hit 'Save' to render the changes.
:::

---

## Authoring: The callout box

**Quarto callout boxes** can be added to highlight particularly important aspects of your document or provide supplementary information.

<div style="font-size: .8em;">

::: callout-important
## Important with Title

This is an example of a callout box to highlight particularly important information using `callout-important`
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout box to give important tips using `callout-tip`
:::

::: callout-note
## Note with Title

This is an example of a callout box to include additional information or context using `callout-note`
:::

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Callout boxes are a way to highlight important information in your document. They stand out visually, so readers immediately notice them. You can use them to emphasize tips, warnings, examples, or key takeaways. <br>
- Observe that the look of the callout boxes changes depending on if "-important," "-tip," or "-note" follows the word "callout" 

**Instructor Notes**:  These are just examples of callout boxes. How to actually create one will be covered in the next slide/task.
:::

---

## Authoring: Inserting a callout box


Here is the markdown text for inserting a **callout note** box:

```{markdown}
::: callout-note
## Based on Real Data

The ChickWeight dataset in R is based on real experimental data.
:::
```

Important elements:

- Begins and ends with 3 colons `:::`
- Specifies the style of the callout box with "`-note`"
- The title of callout box is made by using `##`

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: This is what the Markdown syntax looks like for a callout box. To start and end the callout box, we use 3 colons (`:::`). We will choose the 'note' style by adding the word "note" to the callout. Inside the box, you can add a heading using ## and then add text below it. These aren't just for highlighting important information but can be used for supplementary or by-the-way information as well as warnings.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 4

-   [ ] Copy and paste the markdown text from the previous slide into your Quarto document to add this callout note box.

<br>

<div style="font-size: .8em;">
When rendered, it should look like this:

::: callout-note
## Based on Real Data

The ChickWeight dataset in R is based on real experimental data.
:::
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's add a callout-note box to our document, do this by copying the text from the previous slide and pasting it into your document. Note the important elements and specific details in the formatting (for callout boxes and for all authoring features): beginning and ending with 3 colons (`:::`); single space between the first set of colons and the words "`callout-note`"; nad a single space between `##` and title. When rendered, observe how the callout boxes sets its contents apart from the rest of the document to draw the reader's attention. 

**Instructor Notes**: The aim here is to understand and practice the specific format of a callout box and how it is useful. 
:::

---

## Code chunks

- These are the sections of the document where you can write and execute pieces of code.

- There are multiple ways to insert **code chunks**:

  - Simply click the green Insert Code Chunk button on the toolbar ![](images/Code_Chunk.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of an RStudio toolbar with a red rectangle highlighting the 'Insert a new code chunk' action button which is a green square with a the letter C in its center and a green plus icon to its top-left."} 

  - Manually type 3 back ticks \`\`\` then {r} to start a coding chunk, enter your code, then end the chunk with 3 back ticks

  - Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac) to insert a code chunk then simply enter your code

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Code chunks are sections of a Quarto document where you can run code directly inside your file. They are marked by three backticks followed by the language name, like {r} or {python}. So, using {r} to start the Code Chunk indicates that the coding language that we're using is R. These let us write and execute code, and then display the results, such as tables, plots, or calculations, right in the document. Code chunks make it possible to combine text and analysis in one place, so the document stays reproducible and dynamic. 

**Instructor Notes**: Use ```{r} for this lesson as students will be using R Studio and possession of some background knowledge in R is assumed.
:::

---

## Inserting code chunks

<br>

``` markdown
summary(ChickWeight)
```

<br>

``` markdown
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = Diet)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick)) +
  labs(title = "Chick Growth Over Time")
```

<br>

These are examples of **R code**. Let's use it to insert code chunks in our document. 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: For example, here we are summarizing the ChickWeight dataset, and below, we’re using the `ggplot2` package in R to create a visualization of chick growth over time. Notice how the code is written inside a chunk, and when rendered, Quarto automatically runs the code and shows the results in your output. This is what makes Quarto so powerful, it combines text, code, and results all in one place. It's also possible to see the output of the code before rendering by clicking the small, green arrow at the top-right corner of the code chunk. Hover over it and it would say "Run Current Chunk." 

**Instructor Notes**: If you'd like to simplify the concept of code chunks and have students feel less intimated to use it, you can begin by having them run "1 + 2" in a code chunk and render it to see Quarto run this simple calculation in the output. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 5

-   [ ] Insert the code from the previous slide in *two separate code chunks*

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's run the functions from the previous slides by putting them in code chunks. First create the code chunk then copy and paste the text from the previous slides containing the R functions. Try using different methods to insert coding chunks for this exercise. You don't need to hit Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Command + Enter (Mac) to run the code. After placing it in the coding chunk, rendering the document will run the code and print the output. Render the output and observe how the code appears together with the markdown text from the previous activities, this is what makes Quarto so useful, it gives you one place where you could combine text and code neatly into a single document.

**Instructor Notes**: Note that the code is in two separate text boxes/coding chunks for teaching purposes but can actually both be put in 1 coding chunk. You do not have to start a new coding chunk each time you want to use a different R function. 
:::

---

## Adjusting the code chunks

Adjust how the code is portrayed by editing the YAML header:

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 1;"}

![](images/04_Code_Display.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a summary table displaying the weight, time, and diet information for chicks. Below the table is a line graph with multiple colorful lines. Red rectangles highlight the R code for both the summary table and graph."}
:::
::: {style="flex: 1;"}

- Currently in our YAML header, we have it set to `code-fold: false` which means the code is visible and not collapsible. 

:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Quarto gives us several options for controlling how code appears in our documents. For example, we can choose whether to show or hide the code itself, whether readers can fold code open and closed, or whether only the results are shown. These settings don’t change the analysis, but just change how it’s displayed. This flexibility is helpful because sometimes we want to highlight the process by showing the code, and other times we want readers to focus on the results. <br>
- In open research, showing the underlying code isn’t just a technical choice, it’s important for building trust and reproducibility.

**Instructor Notes**: If useful, clarify that "not collapsible" means that we cannot chose to hide the code, meaning we cannot choose to fold it closed (as we will see when we set it to `code-fold: true`)
:::

---

## Code chunks display settings

Here are some other code display settings that we can incorporate into our YAML header: 

-   `code-fold: true` collapses the code so the reader can expand it
-   `code-tools: true` adds the functions "show code" at the top of the page and "copy" next to the chunks
-   `echo: true` both the code and the output is visible

Let's edit the YAML header to make the code chunks **collapsible** and add **code tools**.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Here are some ways we can change how code is displayed in our rendered website. `echo: true` and `code-fold: false` both affect how code is shown, but in different ways. `echo` decides if the code prints at all, while `code-fold` lets readers toggle it open or closed, deciding whether the code can be hidden or expanded. `code-tools` gives extra functions to the parts of code in the document with the options "show code" and "copy" next to the coding chunks. 

**Instructor Notes**: It's easy to confuse `echo` and `code-fold` because they both deal with code visibility. Be clear on the difference.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 6

In the YAML header:

-   [ ] Change `code-fold: false` to `code-fold: true`
-   [ ] Add `code-tools: true`

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Currently in our YAML header, we have it set to `code-fold: false`. This means the code is visible and not collapsible, but we can change that. Find it in the YAML and simply replace the word "false" with "true." Then, add a new code setting by inserting "`code-tools: true`" right under it. 

**Instructor Notes**: Engage students by asking for possible reasons why one would want their code to be visible or not (optional). 
:::

## Additional authoring features

Quarto offers additional **authoring features** that make it more versatile and comprehensive. These include:

- Adding **links** and **hyperlinking** text
- Embedding **media**
- Creating **multi-column layouts** and more.

::: callout-note
## Commonly used authoring features

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html">link for commonly used markdown syntax</a> for additional authoring features.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Beyond writing plain text, Quarto also incorporates additional features like hyperlinked text, inserting images or videos, and multi-column layouts. These improve how our document communicates. Hyperlinks let us connect to sources or other sections; media like images and video help explain complex ideas more clearly; and multi-column layouts make the content easier to read and more visually appealing. Using these features thoughtfully improves both the usability and the overall look of the document.
:::

---

## Inserting links

Link with title: `[title](link)`

-   `[Quarto Website](https://quarto.org)` → [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/)
-   `[Click here to see more information on reveal.js](https://revealjs.com)` → [Click here to see more information on reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)

Link without title: `<https://link>`

-   `<https://www.markdownguide.org/>` → <https://www.markdownguide.org/>
-   `<https://github.com/>` → <https://github.com/>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: You can insert a link with a title using square brackets for the title (that is, what appears to the reader) and parentheses for the URL. This is helpful when you want the link to be descriptive or if you want to hyperlink written text. You can also add a link without a title by simply wrapping the URL in angle brackets (<...>). This shows the raw link, which is fine if the URL itself is clear and concise enough. A good rule of thumb is to use titled links for readability, and untitled links when you want to show the exact URL.
:::

---

## Inserting images

-   Image by itself with no caption: `![](path/image.png)`

![](images/05_Chick_Pic.png){width="20%" fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image of 3 yellow chicks sitting in the grass."}

-   Image with a caption below it: `![caption](path/image.png)`

![This is a caption about three yellow chicks in the grass.](images/05_Chick_Pic.png){width="20%" fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image of 3 yellow chicks sitting in the grass."}

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: A benefit of using Quarto is the ability to easily add media, such as images, to your documents. You can add the image by itself with no additional text by entering "![](path to the image/name of the image.file)". The "path" tells Quarto where to find the image on your device. If the image is stored in the same folder as your .qmd file, you only need to use the image’s file name. If the image is inside a subfolder (for example, a folder within the folder labelled "Images"), then you just include the folder name in the path, like images/picture.png. <br>
- Images can also be inserted with a caption placed below it. Do so by typing the caption in the square brackets [] after the excamation point !. This helps with clarity and accessibility, since captions explain the relevance of the image. It is also useful in reports, presentations, or academic writing where figures must be labeled. 
:::

---

## Inserting images

You can even add a link to an image so that when you click anywhere on the image, it redirects you to that website. 

-   Image with link: `[![caption](path/image.png)](link)`

[![Click on the image to see a study on broiler chicks](images/05_Chick_Pic.png){width="40%" fig-align="left" fig-alt="An image of 3 yellow chicks sitting in the grass."}](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127819)

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Images can also be inserted with links embedded in them. This allows readers to click and explore more details (for example, linking a screenshot to a website or dataset). This helps keep documents concise while still offering extra resources for those who want them. Having a caption in this case is not necessary but recommended to provide context for what link is attached to the image. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 7

-   [ ] <a href="images/05_Chick_Pic.png" download>Click this link to download the image</a>
-   [ ] Save the image to the main folder of the Quarto document files

``` markdown
![No chicks were harmed in the making of this document.](images/05_Chick_Pic.png)
```
-   [ ] Copy and paste the markdown text above to insert an image with a caption (edit path if needed)

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: For this task, click the link and the image will automatically download. The text inside the square brackets is the caption, and the text inside the parentheses is the path to the image file. Reminder that the path tells Quarto where to look for the image on your deivce. If your image is saved directly in the same folder as your .qmd file, you only need the file name. If it’s in a subfolder, include the folder name in the path.

**Instructor Notes**: The aims are to reinforce how to add images, insert captions, and how paths work. Setting the path can be tricky depending on where the files are located. It’s a good practice to save these files in the same main folder as your Quarto document files (ideally in a dedicated subfolder named "images" to keep paths organized and easy to manage). If students saved and placed their main folder earlier, then locating it should be easy. In the Task above, the text says "images/chickpic1.png" - this assumes the picture is saved in a folder called "Images" in a main folder containing all the Quarto document files.

## Adding citations 

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 0.5;"}

![](images/06_Zotero_Logo.png){width="80%" fig-alt="An image of Zotero's logo. The letter Z in the color red is placed in the center of a white square with rounded edges. The lower-right corner is lifted to reveal written words underneath and four colored tabs are placed around the square."}

:::
::: {style="flex: 1.5;"}

What is **Zotero**? A free reference management tool to collect, organize, cite, and share research sources.

:::
::::::

- You can use **Zotero** in RStudio to easily insert citations into your Quarto document.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Zotero is a reference manager that helps you collect and organize research articles, books, and other sources. When you connect Zotero to Quarto, you can easily insert citations while writing and then automatically generate a reference list at the end. This saves time and reduces errors compared to typing citations manually.
:::

---

## Adding citations with Zotero

![](images/07_Zotero_Toolbar.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of an RStudio toolbar with red rectangles highlighting the 'Source/Visual' mode options and the 'Insert' function."}

To insert a citation:

-   Switch to the "Visual Editor" mode

-   → Add `bibliography: references.bib` in the YAML header

-   → Press the "Insert" button in the toolbar and select "Citation"

A reference list or bibliography is automatically generated at the end of the document with all the citations used.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: To add citations in Quarto, you’ll need Zotero installed on your device. Then, in RStudio, switch to the Visual Editor, which makes citation insertion easier. Make sure your YAML header includes `bibliography: references.bib` so Quarto knows where to look for your references. Then, simply go to the toolbar, click Insert → Citation, and you’ll be able to search your Zotero library directly. Once you add citations in the text, Quarto automatically generates a reference list or bibliography at the end of your document so that you don’t have to format it manually.
:::

---

## Adding citations with Zotero

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 0.5;"}
![](images/08_Zotero_Library.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the dropdown menu under 'Insert' with a red rectangle around the 'Zotero/My Library' option."}
:::
::: {style="flex: 1;"}
- → Select citations straight from the folders in your **Zotero library**

- Each citation is assigned a short citation key based on the author and year (for example, "pauwels2015").

- You can quickly cite it in your document by typing @ followed by the citation key.
:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: When you click "My Library," it mirrors what folders you've created in Zotero Library. This helps you navigate to the folder where the citation is stored. After inserting a citation once, you see what citation key is assigned to it for easier referencing later in the text. The way the citation key is written is different for regular and in-text citations. 

**Instructor Note**: The Zotero program does not need to be open on the device for the "Zotero" option to show up in RStudio. But if it's not appearing like it does in the image, opening the program on the device may help.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 8

Let's practice adding a citation using **Zotero**.

- [ ] Add `bibliography: references.bib` to your YAML header
- [ ] [Follow this link to an article on diets and broiler chicks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127819) 
- [ ] Add the citation to your Zotero Library

```markdown
Diet affects chick body weight. In this study, low-energy feed made fast-growing chicks lighter, while slower-growing chicks compensated by eating more 
```

- [ ] Copy and paste the text above and place the cursor at the end of the sentence

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Let's use Zotero with RStudio to insert citations in our Quarto document and generate a bibliography, this simplifies the referencing process. Follow these steps to add a citation to your Zotero library and add some information extracted from it to your Quarto document. <br>
- There are several ways to add a citation to your Zotero library but an easy way is using the 'magic wand' (adding the item by its identifier). Here, you can just copy the DOI of the study, hit Enter, and it will be added to Zotero. The DOIs of the articles in these tasks will be clearly visible so this method is recommended.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 8

- [ ] In **Visual Mode**, click "Insert" and find the article in the Zotero Library
- [ ] Click "Insert" to add the citation

![When you find the article in the Zotero Library folder here, select it, then click Insert](images/09_Zotero_Insert.png){fig-alt="An image showing the citation key "pauwels2015" and a red rectangle highlighting the 'Insert' option."}

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Follow these steps to add the citation to the end of the text. It is possible to add citations in Source mode, but it is easier and more efficient to do it in Visual mode. This is also a good opportunity to see all the work you've done so far in the Quarto document but now in Visual mode. 
:::

---

## Practical exercise 9

Let's practice adding **in-text** citations:

- [ ] [Follow this link to another article on diets and broiler chicks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153859#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20HDND%20improved%20the,diet%20adversely%20affected%20bone%20mineralization.) 
- [ ] Add the citation to your Zotero Library

```markdown
 found that broiler chicks fed a higher nutrient-density diet gained more weight and did so more efficiently.
```

- [ ] Copy and paste the text above then place your cursor at the beginning of the sentence 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Follow these steps to place an in-text citation at the beginning of the text. This is another article, so you will have to click this new link to go to it and add it to your Zotero library. <br>
- In-text citation is a short reference within the sentence itself that points to the full source that you're citing.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 9

- [ ] Click "Insert" and find the article in the Zotero Library
- [ ] Check the box next to "In-text"

![](images/10_Zotero_InText.png){fig-alt="An image showing the citation key "li2016" and a red rectangle highlighting the ticked 'In-text' checkbox."}

- [ ] Click "Insert" to add the citation

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: The steps to add an in-text citation is almost identical to adding a regular citation with the only difference being checking the "In-text" box before inserting the citation. 
:::

---

## Adding citations with Zotero

:::::: columns
::: column
Now you should have 

- A citation
- An in-text citation 
- A reference list (bibliography)

![](images/11_Zotero_Review.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing two sentences about chick body weight including citations and a bibliography below."}
:::
::::::

::: callout-note
## Changing the citation style

You can change the citation style by using csl files directly from the Zotero website. For example, putting "`csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa`" in your YAML changes the citation style to APA.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: When you render, you should have three key elements in your Quarto document: a citation, an in-text citation, and a reference list or bibliography at the end. As you can see, Quarto does most of the heavy lifting as long as you insert citations correctly and the bibliography builds automatically. Also, if you ever need to follow a specific format, like APA or Chicago, you can easily change the citation style by adding a CSL file in your YAML. It can be a link directly to the Zotero website so that you don't have to download any additional files. 
:::

## Publishing

What is **publishing** with Quarto? The process of sharing the rendered documents or projects online so it can become accessible to others.

- You can publish to:
  - GitHub Pages
  - Quarto Pub
  - A personal website

::: callout-note
## List of publishing services

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/index.html">link for a list of publishing services</a> and more information!
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Publishing in Quarto is all about making your work accessible to others. Once you’ve created and rendered your document, you can share it online so that collaborators, students, or the wider community can view it. Quarto supports multiple publishing options, including GitHub Pages, Quarto Pub, or even your own personal website.

**Instructor Notes**: Keep in mind that the key takeaway here is how publishing turns your local work into something that can be accessed from anywhere.
:::

---

## Publishing

When sharing your work, it's important to follow established **rules and standards**. This includes:

- Considering the legal aspects
- Applying appropriate licenses
- Proper archiving 

::: callout-note
## List of publishing services

<a href="https://lmu-osc.github.io/code-publishing/intro.html">Click here for the LMU OSC page</a> on all you need to know about sharing, copyright, best practices and more.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: As practitioners of open research, sharing your work is more than just making it available. It's also about being responsible and following certain standards. There are legal aspects of sharing that we should consider such as <br>
  - Licenses that define how other may use your work, <br>
  - The importance of archiving to preserve your work in the long run <br>
  - Established best practices to make sure our research remains  credible and reusable.
  
**Instructor Notes**: Aim: To inform students that open science involves thoughtful practices. In this case, sharing should be done with legality, licenses, and reusability in mind. We will not practice this in the session but it is good to know moving forward.

:::

## Publishing to GitHub

A great option to share your document is **publishing to GitHub**.

- **GitHub** is a platform for hosting and sharing code and projects online

- An advantage of GitHub is it allows for **version control**- the ability to track and manage changes over time

- A free and widely used way to publish your Quarto document to GitHub is by using **GitHub Pages**

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: GitHub is one of the most common platforms for sharing code and documents. One of its biggest advantages is version control, which means you can track every change made to your files and even go back to earlier versions if needed. For Quarto, publishing to GitHub is a great option because it’s free, widely used, and makes your work easily accessible to others. The simplest way is through GitHub Pages, which lets you turn your Quarto document into a live website that anyone can access.
:::

---

## Publishing to GitHub

**GitHub Pages** enables you to publish content based on source code managed within a GitHub repository.

- **3 methods** to publish a Quarto document to GitHub Pages:
  1. Render to the `docs` directory and checking it into your repository
  2. Use the `quarto publish` command 
  3. Use GitHub Actions to auto-render and publish whenever you push changes

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: GitHub Pages makes it possible to publish Quarto content as a live website, directly from your GitHub repository. There are three main ways to do this: <br>
  - The simplest way is to render your document to a "docs" folder and commit it to your repository. GitHub Pages can then serve those files as a website. "Docs" here is a folder in your project where you put the files that should be published as a website. <br>
  - You can also use the quarto publish command, which pushes your rendered site to GitHub Pages automatically. <br>
    - For a more advanced setup, you can use GitHub Actions so that every time you push changes to your repository, the site automatically re-renders and updates online. <br>
- Whichever method you use depends on how automated you want the process to be.

:::

---

## Publishing to GitHub 

Let's publish our document using the first method: 

**Render to `docs`**

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: For this lesson, we will publish our completed Quarto document with all the additions we've made to Git Pages using the "Render to docs" method.
:::

---

## Publishing to GitHub

Work directly from the **Terminal** in RStudio. 

- To connect with **Git Bash**, click Terminal → Terminal Options and set it to open with Git Bash 

:::::: columns
::: column
![](images/12_GitBash_Terminal.png){fig-alt="The 'Terminal Options...' option is highlighted with a red rectangle under the Terminal in RStudio."}
:::
::: column

![](images/13_GitBash_Terminal.png){fig-alt="A screenshot displaying the 'Git Bash' option being selected from the dropdown menu under 'New terminals open with:'."}
:::
::::::

- then, click Terminal → New Terminal to begin working with Git Bash

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: When publishing to GitHub, we’ll often use Git Bash, which is a command-line tool for running Git commands. Fortunately, you don’t have to leave RStudio to use it by opening Git Bash directly inside RStudio’s Terminal tab. <br>
- To do this, go to Terminal then Terminal Options, and under ‘New terminals open with,’ select Git Bash. Then, when you click Terminal then click New Terminal, it will open Git Bash automatically, ready for you to start working. <br>
- This setup keeps everything in one place so you don’t need to switch between RStudio and an external terminal. 

**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- Git Bash needs to be installed on the student's device for this to work. <br>
- When you click the drop-down arrow by Terminal, the options may look different than what's in the image in this slide, but the "Terminal Options..." will be at the end (you may have to scroll a bit). <br>
- The last step (open a new Terminal) is important because the current Terminal does not automatically change to Git Bash.

## Practical exercise 11

- [ ] In your Quarto Document, edit YAML and add:

```mardown
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```
- [ ] Set Terminal to open with Git Bash and open new Terminal
- [ ] Change directory to the path of the main folder with the Quarto files using `cd`


::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: <br>
- In this exercise, we’re preparing our Quarto document so it can be published on GitHub Pages. First, edit the YAML header of your Quarto document to define it as a website project and set the output to the docs folder. This tells Quarto where to place the rendered files that GitHub Pages will serve. <br>
- Next, set up your terminal in RStudio to use Git Bash by following the steps in the previous slide. <br>
- From this new Git Bash-Terminal, use the `cd` command to change into the main folder where your Quarto files are stored. This step makes sure any Git commands you run apply to the right project folder. 

**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- Some level of Git knowledge is assumed but here are some common issues that the students can run into: <br>
  - Problems with copying and pasting- copying and pasting with keyboard shortcuts do not work the same in Git Bash. Right-clicking and selecting Paste is an easy option. <br>
  - Setting the directory can be tricky. Backslashes (`\`) need to be changes to forward slashes (`/`). If you're pasting the exact path of the folder, wrap it in quotation marks (`"..."`) OR an easy way to change the directory is by typing `cd` then selecting and dragging the folder directly into Git Bash. This puts the folder path after the `cd` <br>
  - Sometimes in Git Bash-Terminal, just copying and pasting will run the command, but sometimes you need to hit Enter.

## Practical exercise 11

```markdown
echo "project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs" > _quarto.yml
```
- [ ] Make a simple `_quarto.yml` file by copying and pasting the above in the Terminal

```markdown
touch .nojekyll
```
- [ ] Copy and paste the above into the Terminal to add a `.nojekyll` file

:::callout-note
## Why we add `.nojekyll`

Adding a `.nojekyll` file to the root of your repository tells GitHub Pages not to do additional processing of your published site using Jekyll

:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: <br>
- Here, we’re setting up the basic project files GitHub Pages needs in order to publish our Quarto website. <br>
- First, we’ll create a `_quarto.yml` file using the Terminal. This file tells Quarto that the project is a website and that the rendered output should go into the docs folder. <br>
- Next, we’ll add a special file called `.nojekyll`. By default, GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to process websites, but that can interfere with Quarto’s output. Adding a `.nojekyll` file tells GitHub Pages to leave our site exactly as Quarto created it.
:::

---

## Practical exercise 11

```markdown
quarto render
``` 
- [ ] Copy and paste the above into Terminal to generate HTML in the `docs/` folder

```markdown
git init
git branch -M main  
```
- [ ] Copy and paste the above into Terminal to initialize Git and rename "master" to "main"

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: <br>
- Running `quarto render` in the Terminal takes your Quarto project and produces the HTML files in the docs folder. These are the files GitHub Pages will serve as your website. <br>
- Next, we need to initialize Git in the project folder so we can connect it to GitHub. The command `git init` sets up Git tracking, and `git branch -M main` renames the default branch from "master" to "main," which is the standard branch name used in this session.

**Instructor Notes**: You will see a warning about "`references.bib not found in resource path`" which usually happens because Quarto looks for the file in the project’s root or resource path, but Git Bash is case-sensitive and strict with paths. So, you will see in your completed Git Pages web page that the citations look strange but we will leave it like that for now. Extra steps are needed to correct this that won't be covered in this lesson but can be explored further independently. 
:::

## Practical exercise 11

- [ ] Go to [GitHub](github.com) and create a new repository
- [ ] In Terminal, connect to local project by using "`git remote add origin`" + the repo's HTTPS URL (for example, "`git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/chickweight-exercise.git`")

```markdown
quarto render
git add docs
git commit -m "Publish site to docs/"
git push -u origin main
```
- [ ] Copy and paste the above into Terminal to render your site and push it to GitHub
- [ ] In your repo on [GitHub](github.com), go to Settings 
- [ ] Click "Pages" to configure GitHub Pages

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Now to put everything together. We need to create a new, public repository on GitHub which is where our project files will be held. Then, we connect our local project to GitHub using `git remote add origin` followed by the repository’s HTTPS link (found on the GitHub website). This tells Git where to send the files when we push them with `git push -u origin main`.

**Instructor Notes**: For this to work, it's important that the repository created is set to Public.

## Practical exercise 11

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 1;"}

- [ ] Change "none" to "main"

:::
::: {style="flex: .65;"}

![](images/15_GitPages_Settings.png)

:::
::::::

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}

- [ ] Change "/root" to "/docs" 
- [ ] Click Save

:::
::: {style="flex: .65;"}

![](images/16_GitPages_Settings.png)

:::
::::::

- After 1-2 minutes, you will see that your site will be **live**! 

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: The final steps to make the site public is to configure the GitHub repository settings under "Pages." Change None" to "main," this switches us to the branch we are working on. Then change "/(root)" to "/docs" which will switch the folder where Quarto rendered the website files. After clicking Save, your site will be live after a minute or two. 

**Instructor Notes**: Reminder that the citations will not be complete because configuring to include the bibliography was not done. That's an additional step.

## Recap 

**About Quarto**

- Quarto is a powerful tool that combines text, code, and media to make documents which are transparent, reproducible, and accessible.
- In a **.qmd file**:
  - The **YAML header** controls the document settings
  - **Code chunks** run code and show results
  - **Markdown text** creates the main content
- You can use simple formatting and keyboard shortcuts for styling text.
  - `**bold**` → **bold**
  - `*italic*` → *italic*
  
::: {.notes}
**Speaker Note**: <br>
- Here are some of the key things covered in the lesson that give a general overview of Quarto and what it contains. <br>
- Quarto is more than just a tool to write documents, it’s designed to bring together text, code, and media in one .qmd file that ensures transparency and reproducibility. <br>
- Quarto supports simple formatting, like bold and italics, which makes writing cleaner and more efficient without the need for complex styling tools.

**Instructor Note**: The idea of this slide is to give a recap of important elements aobut Quarto covered in the lesson.
