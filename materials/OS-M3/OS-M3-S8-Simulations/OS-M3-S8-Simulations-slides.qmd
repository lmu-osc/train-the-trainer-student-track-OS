## General  feedback - delete slide later
<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
Nice work Wini, here an overview (dont worry about the red font)

- Instructor notes are missing from most slides, read up on the difference between the two and add instructor notes (and accessibility tips if applicable)
- Include more practical activities where students need to first think about existing knowledge and how it fits with the presented concepts
- For the What are simulations section, I think there may be three slides with a similar activity?
- Careful with generic bullet points (e.g., why are simulations used in research), give examples or real life scenarios where possible and spend a bit more time here on finding out what the student's perspective is here before you present them with "the answer"
- The graph on the basic simulation process in R is a good idea, but perhaps needs a but more context - did you already say somewhere that you can do this in R? And provide the prospect that they will practise this, or leave the practical aspect (i.e., the tutorial) for later (also revise slide 24, the third learning goals is not achieved this far)
- Power analysis and the why: I think again here I am missing the interaction with students and concrete examples, the bullet points are too generic
- Slide 27 is difficult to follow, but really important
- Add a preview of the self-paced tutorial and the practical aspect /assignment where they will actually learn how to RUN a simulation
- Generally for the reader I think you are too fast and remain a little too vague and abstract: more practical exercise related to thinking for themseles and then providing examples that brings it home ("Why on earth would I need to care about this")
- Check the formatting guidelines again for titles, bullet points etc. in the manual to make it consistent throughout

## Prerequisites

::: {.callout-important}
Before completing this submodule, please carefully read about the prerequisites.
:::

| Prerequisite   |  Description  | Link/Where to find it   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Have R and RStudio installed | If you don’t, follow these instructions: | https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ |
| Know some R basics | e.g. how to select a value in a data frame, how to create a vector | [Download Link](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-R/) |
| Basic statistical concepts | Like descriptive statistics, data analysis, statistical reasoning | [Download Link](to be updated) |

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
Sort out this table: add  specific previous submodules they need to do, and make sure that the table fits on the slide, else make the font in the table smaller. the R basics prerequisite would just be our submodule slides right? Anything else you can think about except for R? 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Before we begin this submodule, please take a moment to review the prerequisites listed here.
First, you should already have R and RStudio installed. If not, the link on the slide will guide you through the installation.
Next, you’ll need some basic familiarity with R — for example, how to select values in a data frame or how to create simple vectors. There’s a tutorial by OSC linked here in case you’d like to refresh those skills.
Finally, you should be comfortable with basic statistical concepts, such as descriptive statistics and fundamental data analysis ideas. There is a link to a cheatsheet on these concepts provided here.
If any of these areas feel unfamiliar, I encourage you to explore the resources before moving forward, so the rest of the tutorial is smooth and accessible. 
**Instructor Notes**: These are the prerequisites for this submodule. Before you get started on this submodule with your audience, you need to ensure that the audience fulfills these criteria. With a show of hands, you can know how many students would want to work through these resources provided; if the majority do, then a bit of time can be provided here, till they are comfortable to move forward.

## Covered in this session

- **Aim**: To understand the theoretical reasoning behind simulations and power analysis in R and the process of running these simulations.
- **Topics Covered**:
 - Simulations in research and basic process in R.
 - Power analysis and using simulations for it.
 
 <div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
Here I think the aim bullet point was for the sake of the template, I think a list of topics covered here is enough, make sure there is no redundancy with the learning goals in how you phrase things. Also no short forms (I'm, don't etc.) in the speaker or instructor notes, we defined that little formatting feature in the manual.  
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: In this session, we’ll focus on the core ideas behind simulations and power analysis in R. First, we’ll look at what simulations are and the basic steps for running them. Then we’ll connect this to power analysis and see how simulations can support it. 
:::

---

## Learning goals

- Students will define the meaning of simulations and where they are used.
- Students will explain the need for simulations in research.
- Students will analyse the process of running a simulation in R, and apply the process to an example.
- Students will recall the concept of power analysis and its importance.
- Students will differentiate between traditional and simulation-based methods.
- Students will analyse the simulation process for power analyse.

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
I think you can leave out the "Student" and just say differentiate xvz etc. Also highlight the verbs in **bold** if you like. Another point: make sure these learning goals cover Bloom's taxonomy 1 - 4 and order them accordingly. 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: In this session, we’ll work toward several learning goals, which reflect various sub-sections on the topic. These goals will be repeated after each sub-section so you can check your understanding, raise questions, and keep track of your progress.

**Instructor Notes**: Use this time to discuss any doubts the students may have on the learning goals and their assessment.

## Key terms and definitions

- **Simulations**: Simulations are computer experiments that generate artificial data by pseudo-random sampling, allowing researchers to evaluate statistical methods under controlled, known conditions (Morris et al., 2019).
- **Power Analysis**: Power analysis is a statistical method used to determine the probability that a study will detect a true effect (if it exists) or, equivalently, the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (Steidl et al., 1997). 
- **Effect Size**: Effect size quantifies the magnitude and direction of a difference or relationship between groups or variables (Lorah, 2018).

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
For this slide, perhaps a think-pair share expercise could work? For the integration of old and new concepts?
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Here are a few key terms that will appear throughout the session.
We’ll use the word simulations to talk about computer-generated data created through pseudo-random sampling.
Power analysis refers to estimating the probability of detecting a true effect.
And effect size tells us how large or meaningful that effect is.
You don’t need to memorise these right now — this is just a quick introduction. We’ll return to these definitions later as we apply them, so for now simply get familiar with the terms.

**Instructor  Notes**: Introduce the terms briefly to activate students’ prior conceptions. Keep the slide short.

## 1.1 What are Simulations?

**Let's flip a coin**

- Imagine you want to flip a coin *100 times*, and see the results.

- ~~Actually flipping the coin~~ -> Pretend to flip in mind...

- And write down the results each time.
- This pretending is called a **simulation**.

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
I think we had agreed on not necessarily numbering the slides - that would be more for a quarto book perhaps. Also see the formatting in the qmd here to get bullet points :) 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker notes**: Imagine you want to find out how many times you might get heads if you flip a coin 100 times. Instead of flipping the coin for real, you can pretend to flip the coin many times in your mind or on paper and write down the results each time. This pretending is called a simulation.

**Instructor Notes**: Use this basic coin example to set the ground for 'simulations'. Encourage the students to ponder upon this example as a real experiment for a short bit, to understand how they can 'simulate' the data in their minds.
:::

---

## 1.1 What are Simulations?
contd...
<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
?
</div>

- In a simulation, you make up data that acts like what you expect in the real world. 
- You do this again and again to see what kind of results you can get.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Try This Yourself
Run a **mental simulation** of flipping a coin a *100 times*. Make a note of how many times would you get heads and how many tails.
:::

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
How does this activity differ from the one on the previous slide?
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker notes**: In this part, we’re looking at what simulations really are. A simulation basically means creating data that behaves the way we expect real-world data to behave. We repeat this process many times to see the range of outcomes we might get.
To get an intuitive feel for it, there’s a quick activity: imagine flipping a coin a hundred times. Think about how many heads and tails you’d expect. This mental experiment reflects the same logic behind running simulations in R.

**Instructor Notes**: Keep the explanation simple and intuitive. The goal here is to form an initial understanding before diving into technical detail.
:::

---

## 1.2 Why are Simulations Used in Research?

Before we begin...<br>

::: {.callout-tip}
## Create a hypothesis
Get together in a pair, and create a hypothesis about the **coin flips**. For example, *When I flip the coin 100 times, the number of heads will be greater than tails.*
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Before we explore why simulations are important in research, we’ll start with a quick exercise: Pair up and create a simple hypothesis about the coin-flip scenario from earlier. For example: When I flip a coin 100 times, I’ll get more heads than tails.
This 'experiment' shall help you connect each point to your own hypothesis.

**Instructor Notes**: Give the students 2 minutes to develop their hypothesis; welcome creativity here.
:::

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
In the formatting I think we also had a point about not capitalising the slide title or call out box titles - do check and correct me if I am wrong! And also, so on the previous slide they also already did this by themselves right? Can you combine this slide, the previous one and the next one?
</div>

---

## 1.2 Why are Simulations Used in Research? *contd*

1. **To build statistical intuition**: Simulations let you see how data behaves—for example, why sometimes results are different even if you do the same experiment. <br>
2. **To understand sampling and probability**: Simulations help you picture what’s likely to happen and what’s unusual.  <br>
3. **To perform power analysis**: Scientists use simulations to check how likely their experiments are to find real effects.  <br>
4. **To support pre-Analysis planning**: Before running a real experiment, researchers simulate what they expect might happen. <br>
5. **To enable bootstrapping and flexible inference**: Simulations can reuse existing data to estimate any uncertainty without many strict assumptions. <br>

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
I think this slide here sounds a little too generic and almost like something ChatGPT would say - was this how it was explained in the existing tutorial or was this not featured? I think at this point as a student in your course, I am not there yet and havent had  a chance to think about why simulations can be useful in research?  Also sort out the speaker notes, the bullet points I think are not coming out the way you planned? I would also leave out the contd from the title :) And I think examples for each of these whys would be useful, this is too vague and abstract for now. 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: •	Build Statistical Intuition: Simulations let you see how data behaves, helping you grasp concepts like variability and sampling—things that formulas alone can’t easily show. This makes abstract ideas more concrete and understandable. <br>
•	Understand Sampling and Probability: By simulating repeated samples, you can visualize sampling distributions and understand why statistics like standard errors vary from sample to sample.<br>
•	Perform Power Analysis and Plan Studies: They help estimate the chance your study will detect a true effect (power), especially when study designs are complicated and formulas don’t work well.<br>
•	Support Pre-Analysis Planning: Researchers can simulate expected results before collecting real data, which helps catch problems early and improve research plans.<br>
•	Enable Bootstrapping and Flexible Inference: Simulations resample data to estimate confidence intervals without relying on strict assumptions, making analyses more robust.

## 1.2 Why are Simulations Used in Research? *contd*

Most importantly, simulations promote **transparency** and **reproducibility**.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Relate it to your Hypothesis
Get together in your pair, and discuss how simulating your data for your experiment is useful, using any one of the pointers above.
:::

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
As a reader, I think the jump here to transparency is quite big - maybe with an example? And which pointers? 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: And its connection with open science? Simulations promote transparency and reproducibility since the code and data can be shared openly, allowing others to validate and extend the work. Open tools and tutorials make advanced statistical methods more accessible, democratizing research and education.

**Instructor Notes**: After discussing the pointers, let the students brainstorm and justify the simulation of data in their experiment, and share it in class.

## 1.3 Basic Simulation Process in R

  <img src="images/g (1).png" style="width:50%;" />
</div>

:::{.callout-tip}
## Relate it to your Hypothesis
Get together in your pair, and discuss how you would simulate your data according to this process.
:::

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
Go over the creation manual again and check out the section on image file naming etc. I think this is too small to read? Can you edit the figure to increase the font size within the boxes? And you say here simulate your data? What data? Remember the student perspective, we have just discussed why using simulations is maybe useful. 
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Here’s the basic process behind running a simulation.
First, decide how many data points (sample size) you want — for example, simulating a 100 coin flips. Thus, n = 100.
Next, generate the fake data using a random method that mimics the real outcome, such as randomly assigning ‘heads’ or ‘tails’ with equal probability.
Then analyse this simulated dataset just as you would analyse real data — you might count how many heads you got or calculate a simple summary.
After that, repeat the simulation many times to see how the results vary from run to run.
Finally, bring everything together by summarising the outcomes across all repetitions.
This gives you a clear picture of the variation you can expect if the experiment were done in real life.”

**Instructor Notes**: After discussing the pointers, let the students brainstorm and justify the simulation of data in their experiment, and share it in class.

## 2.1 What is Power Analysis and its Importance?

**Let's flip the coin again, *but how many times?* ** <br>
- **Power analysis** is like figuring out how many times you need to flip a coin -> to be pretty sure you can tell if the coin is fair or not. <br>
- **Power** = your chance of catching the coin's true nature if it really is biased. <br>
 - If power = 80% -> you have an 80% chance of spotting a bias if it's really there. <br>

-Power depends on <br>
 - the effect size (*how biased the coin might be*) <br>
 - the sample size (*how many times you flip the coin*) <br>
 - the significance level (*how sure you want to be*)
 
 <div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
This slide is super full and the reader struggles to understand what is the main message here, perhaps a visualisation can help somehow? Or more like a graphic illustration with some of the text in the speaker notes? The first bullet point I think I also dont fully understand?
</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: In this section, we’re looking at what power analysis means and why it matters.
Think back to our coin example — the question now is: How many times should we flip the coin to confidently decide whether it’s fair?
Power analysis helps us figure that out.
Power is simply the chance of detecting a real effect if it truly exists.
So if the power is 80 percent, that means we have an 80 percent chance of noticing a bias when the coin is actually biased. <br>
Power depends on three things: the effect size — or how strong the bias might be, the sample size — how many flips we collect, and the significance level — how strict we want our decision rule to be.
Keep your earlier hypothesis in mind as we talk through these ideas.

**Instructor Notes**: This is the moment to clear out any confusion regarding the neighbouring concepts of effect size and significance level. If the students seem comfortable with the concepts, you can opt for a higher-level explanation reflecting the 'correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis' notion.
:::

---

## 2.1 What is Power Analysis and its Importance? *contd*

1. **Prevents Underpowered Studies**: It makes sure you don’t do an experiment that’s too small and miss something real. <br>
2. **Optimizes Resource Use**: helps you figure out the smallest number of times you need to do your experiment to have a good chance. This way, you don’t waste time or resources. <br>
3. **Required for Transparency and Publication**: a proof that your plan is strong enough.

<div style="font-size: 0.5em; color: red;">
I think here you are a little far ahead, give students a chance to think about importance first, and see what they come up with. Also similar to another list you had before, these are vague and generic points and students may not understand the meaning (what is underpowered?). The callout box with the relate it to your hypothesis as title is also slightly abstract, did you mean to change that? Careful with including these generic statements, they might not help students very much. 
</div>

:::{.callout-tip}
## Relate it to your Hypothesis
Get together in your pair, and discuss how conducting power analysis for your experiment is useful, using any one of the pointers above.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Prevents Underpowered Studies: Low power increases the risk of missing true effects, leading to inconclusive or misleading results. <br>
Optimizes Resource Use: Power analysis helps determine the minimum sample size needed, balancing scientific rigor with practical constraints. <br>
Required for Funding and Publication: Many funding agencies and journals require power analysis to justify sample size and study feasibility.
:::

---

## 2.2 Why Simulations are better for Power Analysis?

- **Quick formula method**: Imagine a simple math formula that tells you how many times to do something, like flipping a coin, to be pretty sure of your results. This method works fast and is good when the experiment is simple.

- **Simulation method**: This is like pretending to do the experiment many times on a computer before actually doing it. You create fake results based on what you think will happen. This way is better when the experiment is tricky or has many parts that are hard to predict.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Relate it to your Hypothesis
Get together in your pair, and discuss how you would simulate your data according to this process.
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: 1. Set up your model and data:
Decide what variables you have and how they behave (e.g., normal, binomial).
Choose sample size and any parameters (means, variances, effect size). <br>
2. Simulate one dataset:
Generate random data that follow your chosen distributions.<br>
Optionally “add” an effect (e.g., a difference between two groups).<br>
3. Analyse the simulated data:
Run the planned statistical test (e.g., t-test, regression).
Record the key result (e.g., p-value, estimate).<br>
4. Repeat the experiment many times:
Loop over steps 2–3 a large number of times.
Collect all test results into a single dataset.<br>
5. Summarise and interpret:
Compute the proportion of simulations with a significant result (this is the estimated power).
