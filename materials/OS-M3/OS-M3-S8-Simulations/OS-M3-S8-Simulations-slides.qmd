## Prerequisites

::: {.callout-important}
Before completing this submodule, please carefully read about the prerequisites.
:::

| Prerequisite   |  Description  | Link/Where to find it   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Have R and RStudio installed | If you don’t, follow these instructions: | https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ |
| Know some R basics | e.g. how to select a value in a data frame, how to create a vector | [Download Link](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-R/) |
| Basic statistical concepts | Like descriptive statistics, data analysis, statistical reasoning | [Download Link](to be updated) |

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Before we begin this submodule, please take a moment to review the prerequisites listed here.
First, you should already have R and RStudio installed. If not, the link on the slide will guide you through the installation.
Next, you’ll need some basic familiarity with R — for example, how to select values in a data frame or how to create simple vectors. There’s a tutorial by OSC linked here in case you’d like to refresh those skills.
Finally, you should be comfortable with basic statistical concepts, such as descriptive statistics and fundamental data analysis ideas. There is a link to a cheatsheet on these concepts provided here.
If any of these areas feel unfamiliar, I encourage you to explore the resources before moving forward, so the rest of the tutorial is smooth and accessible. 
**Instructor Notes**: These are the prerequisites for this submodule. Before you get started on this submodule with your audience, you need to ensure that the audience fulfills these criteria. With a show of hands, you can know how many students would want to work through these resources provided; if the majority do, then a bit of time can be provided here, till they are comfortable to move forward.

:::

---

## Covered in this session

- **Aim**: To understand the theoretical reasoning behind simulations and power analysis in R and the process of running these simulations.
- **Topics Covered**:
 - Simulations in research and basic process in R.
 - Power analysis and using simulations for it.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: In this session, we’ll focus on the core ideas behind simulations and power analysis in R. First, we’ll look at what simulations are and the basic steps for running them. Then we’ll connect this to power analysis and see how simulations can support it. 
:::

---

## Learning goals

- Students will define the meaning of simulations and where they are used.
- Students will explain the need for simulations in research.
- Students will analyse the process of running a simulation in R, and apply the process to an example.
- Students will recall the concept of power analysis and its importance.
- Students will differentiate between traditional and simulation-based methods.
- Students will analyse the simulation process for power analyse.

  
::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: In this session, we’ll work toward several learning goals, which reflect various sub-sections on the topic. These goals will be repeated after each sub-section so you can check your understanding, raise questions, and keep track of your progress.

**Instructor Notes**: Use this time to discuss any doubts the students may have on the learning goals and their assessment.

## Key terms and definitions

- **Simulations**: Simulations are computer experiments that generate artificial data by pseudo-random sampling, allowing researchers to evaluate statistical methods under controlled, known conditions (Morris et al., 2019).
- **Power Analysis**: Power analysis is a statistical method used to determine the probability that a study will detect a true effect (if it exists) or, equivalently, the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. 
- **Effect Size**: Effect size quantifies the magnitude and direction of a difference or relationship between groups or variables

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Add script for slide here.

**Instructor  Notes**: Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine existing concepts in relation to some key terms. Re-examine the formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson. 
:::

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Script for the slide here.

**Instructor Notes**: This pre-break survey serves to examine students' current understanding of key concepts of the submodule. Guidance on interpreting the results:

- If more than 80% of the students select the correct response option, show which one it is and move on.

- If less than 80% of answers are correct, let them discuss with each other for 1-2 minutes which one they selected, and why, and afterwards let them re-take the question. If they`re above 80% correct the second time, move on, else show the correct response and explain why it is correct (plus maybe why the others are not).

- If more than 30% select a specific distractor answer, discuss it in class.
