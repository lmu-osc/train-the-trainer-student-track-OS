**What does "research" even mean?**

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Add script for slide here. 
**Instructor  Notes**: Use the think-pair-share method: Students write down for themselves for a minute what a definition of research could be, then pair with a neighbour to compare answers. Final answers are then discussed in the plenum.

## What does "research" even mean?

"Research refers to a careful, well-defined (or redefined), objective, and **systematic method** of **search for knowledge**, or **formulation** of a theory that is driven by inquisitiveness for that which is unknown and useful on a particular aspect so as to make an original contribution to expand the existing knowledge base. Research involves the **formulation of hypothesis** or **proposition of solutions**, data analysis, and deductions; and ascertaining whether the conclusions fit the hypothesis. Research is a **process of creating, or formulating knowledge that does not yet exist.**"

## What is "trust" in research (general public perspective)?


- "*Society trusts that scientific research results are an honest and accurate reflection of a researcher’s work.*" <div style="display: flex; font-size: 0.55em; color: #777;">(Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy 2009: ix)</div>


- "*The public must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public policy decisions.*" <div style="display: flex; font-size: 0.55em; color: #777;">(Obama 2009)</div>

## What is "trust" in research?

- No consensus on definition from the perspective fo researchers but:
  - Trust is essential for **effective collaboration** among researchers (includes co-authorship, peer review, data sharing, replication, teaching, mentoring etc.)
  - Authors submitting papers or grant proposals rely on reviewers to evaluate their work competently, fairly, and confidentially
  - Scientists reading published research trust that the **work was conducted as described**, that **all relevant methodological details** are **disclosed**, and that the data have *not been fabricated or falsified*

## The Reproducibility Project (2015)

- Large-scale replication project:
  - 100 studies from 3 different journals
  - Close/exact replications
  - Contacted original study authors
  - Open materials and data

</div>

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: The Reproducibility Project by the Open Science Collaboration (2015) involved a large-scale, collaborative effort by over 270 researchers. They selected 100 experimental studies published between 2008 and 2012 in three top psychology journals: Psychological Science, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition.
For each study, they carefully reviewed the original materials, methods, and analyses, and often contacted the original authors for clarification or access to materials and protocols. Each replication aimed to match the original study’s sample size, experimental design, and analysis plan as closely as possible, while making only minimal changes when exact materials were unavailable. The replications were preregistered to specify hypotheses, design, and analysis before data collection, reducing bias and “researcher degrees of freedom." Data collection was conducted independently from the original research teams, often in multiple labs to ensure rigor. After data collection, they analyzed the results using the same statistical methods as the original studies to determine whether the findings could be reproduced. The project also evaluated effect sizes, not just statistical significance, to compare the magnitude of the original and replicated effects. **Only 39% of the replications produced statistically significant results, and the median effect size in replications was about half that of the original studies, highlighting the reproducibility challenges in psychology**.

**"If it works, I can publish it; if it does not, let me put it into my file drawer."**

```{=html}

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/file-drawer.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
  
```

  <!-- Right side: bullet points -->
  <div style="flex: 1;">
**Publication bias** happens when studies with positive or significant results are much more likely to be published than studies with negative or non-significant results.
  </div>

## Example publication bias

De vries et al study

```{=html}

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/12_Publication-bias.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
  
```

  <!-- Right side: bullet points -->
  <div style="flex: 1;">

  - Study publication bias: non-publication of an entire study
  - Outcome reporting bias: non-publication of negative outcomes within a published article or switching the status of (non-significant) primary and (significant) secondary outcomes
  - Spin: authors conclude that the treatment is effective despite non-significant results on the primary outcome
  - Citation bias: Studies with positive results receive more citations than negative studies

## Null-Hypothesis-Testing

**Example**: Does this new drug work better to decrease flu-symptoms compared to an existing drug?

- The null hypothesis (H₀) is the idea that nothing special is happening—for example, “the new drug is no better than the existing one.”
- You then collect data from experiments and perform a statistical analysis to see if the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis.
- The **p-value** tells you how likely it is to see the results you got **if the null hypothesis is actually true**.
- A p-value of 0.05 means: “There’s a 5% chance of seeing these results (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true.”


::: {.callout-important}
A p-value of 0.05 means that we accept a 5% chance that our results came about by pure luck (if the results were accidental, we would speak of a false positive result)

# Increasing your false positive rates can happen in the blink of an eye!

::: {.callout-warning}
Do **not** try at home.

## Have you ever ...?

- Neglected to blind data collection?
- Added more outcome variables in the analysis process and reported only the outcome variables that produced a significant effect?
- Ran many different comparisons on different subsets/groups etc.?
- Stopped data collection when you obtained the result you were looking for?
- Continued sampling after finding a null result?
- Reformulated your hypotheses based on what you found?
- Excluded outliers based on the significance of your results
- Tested excluding, including, or transforming covariates, but only reported the final model?
- Neglected to report all the dependent measures you tested?

---

## Hack 1: Adding lots of outcome variables

- For **two outcome variables**: False positive rate increases from 5% to **9.5%**

- For **five outcome variables**: False positive rate increases from 5% to **41%**

## Hack 2: Run as many comparisons as possible


```{=html}

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/06_Reporting_Conditions.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
  
```

  <!-- Right side: bullet points -->
  <div style="flex: 1;">

  - Run as many different comparisons on different outcomes, subgroups, time windows etc. as you can
  - Only report the comparisons that produced a statistically significant result

## Hack 3: Stop collecting data whenever you found what you were looking for


```{=html}

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/15_optional_stopping.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
  
```

  <!-- Right side: bullet points -->
  <div style="flex: 1;">

  - Collect an initial sample, analyze the results, add participants if the results are not significant
  - Stop when significance is found
      - One analysis: α = 5%
      - Two analyses: α = 11%
      - But with enough “just looking”  can be pushed to 100%!

## Hack 4: Drop participants you do not like


```{=html}

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/08_Selective_Exclusion.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  </div>
  
```

  <!-- Right side: bullet points -->
  <div style="flex: 1;">

  - Selectively exclude data/ outliers after seeing the results until the results are satisfying (aka until significance has been reached)

## Tip 2: Experiment with many conditions, but report only those that worked


```{=html}

## Tip 3: Stop collecting data whenever you feel like it

- Collect an initial sample, analyze the results, add additional participants if not significant, stop when significance is found

- Increase twice: α = 11%

- But with enough looks can be pushed to 100%!



---

## Tip 4: Drop participants that you did not like

- Selective exclusion of data/outliers after seeing the results until the results are satisfying (aka until significance has been reached)

![](images/08_Selective_Exclusion.png){fig-align=center width=50% fig-alt="selective exclusion"}

---

## Tip 5: HARK-ing (personal favourite)

- **H**ypothesizing **A**fter **R**esults are **K**nown = presenting an exploratory finding to match a hypothesis that was created only after analysing the results

---

## Tip 6: Run as many different comparisons as humanly possible

- Run many different comparisons on different outcomes, subgroups, time windows, etc., and only report the comparison that produced p < 0.05

SPEAKER NOTES: Each time you try another independent test at α = 0.05 you have a 5% chance of a Type I error for that test. If you perform many uncorrected tests, the chance that at least one will be (falsely) significant rises quickly. For example, doing 20 independent tests at α = 0.05 gives a probability of at least one false positive of
1 − (1 − 0.05)²⁰ = 1 − 0.95²⁰ ≈ 0.6415 (≈64%).

## Quality, rigor and integrity

*The smartest heads in the world immerse themselves into a research topic for years. In that process, they become the experts – nobody knows more about that topic. 
The boundaries of knowledge have been pushed forward. When the scientist are confident in their findings, they publish them in the best scientific journals, with the highest standards of quality, rigor, and integrity.*

How much of that literature is true do you think?

**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- **Aim**: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic.
- For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, students should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break).
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).
- Use multiple slides for this part.
