**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- **Aim**: The pre-submodule survey serves to examine students' prior knowledge about the submodule's topic.
- Use free survey software such as particify or formR to establish the following questions (shown on separate slides).
:::

---

**What is your level of familiarity with Open Research practices in general (e.g., basic concepts, terminology, or tools)?**

a. I am unfamiliar with the concept of Open Research practices.

b. I have heard of them but I would not know how they applies to my work.

c. I have basic understanding and experience with Open Research practices in my own work. 

d. I am very familiar with Open Research practises and routinely apply them in my daily research routines.

---

**In your research, when do you think about research quality and integrity?**

b. In the planning process

c. Concept 3

d. Throughout the entire research process

---

**On a scale from 1 to 5, how trusting are you of published results in the field of psychology? (1 = not trusting any of the results, 2 = trusting only some results, 3 = trusting about half of the results, 4 = trusting the majority of the results,  5 =  trusting all results)**

a. 1

b. 2

c. 3

d. 4

e. 5

- Examples: 
  - Students will **describe** the process of photosynthesis or
  - Students will **construct** a diagram illustrating the process of photosynthesis

# The challenges in research

## .. right??

![](images/07_holy_grail.png){fig-align=center width=50% fig-alt="chasing significance"}

---

## Quality, rigor and integrity

*The smartest heads in the world immerse themselves into a research topic for years. In that process, they become the experts – nobody knows more about that topic. 
The boundaries of knowledge have been pushed forward. When the scientist are confident in their findings, they publish them in the best scientific journals, with the highest standards of quality, rigor, and integrity.*

::: {.callout-important}
How much of that literature is true do you think?

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Script for the slide here. 

**Instructor Notes**: Add.

## Why should we trust researchers?

![](images/01_snakesman_researcher.png){fig-align=center width=100% fig-alt="snakesman analogy"}

::: {.notes}
**Speaker notes**: Add script for the slide here. 
**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- **Aim**: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic.
- For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, students should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break).
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).
- Use multiple slides for this part.

## Tip 1: Report only outcome variables you "like" and/or silently add other outcomes

- For **two outcome variables**: False positive rate increases from 5% to **9.5%**

- - For **five outcome variables**: False positive rate increases from 5% to **41%**

## Tip 3: Stop collecting data whenever you please

- Collect an initial sample, analyze the results, add additional participants if not significant, stop when significance is found

- Increase twice: α = 11%

- But with enough looks can be pushed to 100%!



---

## Tip 4: Drop participants that you did not like

- Selective exclusion of data/outliers after seeing the results until the results are satisfying (aka until significance has been reached)

![](images/08_Selective_Exclusion.png){fig-align=center width=50% fig-alt="selective exclusion"}



---

## Tip 5: HARK-ing (personal favourite)

- **H**ypothesizing **A**fter **R**esults are **K**nown = presenting an exploratory finding to match a hypothesis that was created only after analysing the results

---

## Tip 6: Run as many different comparisons as humanly possible

- Run many different comparisons on different outcomes, subgroups, time windows, etc., and only report the comparison that produced p < 0.05



SPEAKER NOTES: Each time you try another independent test at α = 0.05 you have a 5% chance of a Type I error for that test. If you perform many uncorrected tests, the chance that at least one will be (falsely) significant rises quickly. For example, doing 20 independent tests at α = 0.05 gives a probability of at least one false positive of
1 − (1 − 0.05)²⁰ = 1 − 0.95²⁰ ≈ 0.6415 (≈64%).

## (Un)Intentional? 


Evil researcher who only cares about his/her career and not at all about truth-seeking?
„We urge the social science community to redefine p-hacking as a series of deceptive research practices rather than ones that are merely questionable.“ (Craig et al., 2020)
Unintentional?
Wrong education?
Wrong/uncritical standards of the field?
Pushed by supervisors, reviewers, or editors? ➙ http://bulliedintobadscience.org/
 Distorting effects on the published record are probably comparable, but the ethical evaluations differs strongly.




---

## How to spot possible p-hacking

- Large number of uncorrected comparisons with selective reporting

- Many p values bunching just below 0.05

- Lack of pre registration or analysis plan when claims are confirmatory

- Results that disappear under slight analytic changes or when full data/code are provided.
