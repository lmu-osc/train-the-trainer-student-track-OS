## Before we start - survey time



::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes**: Script for the slide here. 
**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- **Aim**: The pre-submodule survey serves to examine students' prior knowledge about the submodule's topic.
- Use free survey software such as particify or formR to establish the following questions (shown on separate slides).
:::

---

**What is your level of familiarity with Open Research practices in general (e.g., basic concepts, terminology, or tools)?**

a. I am unfamiliar with the concept of Open Research practices.

b. I have heard of them but I would not know how they applies to my work.

c. I have basic understanding and experience with Open Research practices in my own work. 

d. I am very familiar with Open Research practises and routinely apply them in my daily research routines.

---

**In your research, when do you think about research quality and integrity?**

a. I do not think these principles are relevant for my research. 

b. In the planning process

c. Concept 3

d. Throughout the entire research process

---

**On a scale from 1 to 5, how trusting are you of published results in the field of psychology? (1 = not trusting any of the results, 2 = trusting only some results, 3 = trusting about half of the results, 4 = trusting the majority of the results,  5 =  trusting all results)**

a. 1

b. 2

c. 3

d. 4

e. 5

## Learning goals

- **Aim**: Formulate specific, action-oriented goals learning goals which are measurable and observable in line with Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956)

- Place an emphasis on the **verbs** of the learning goals and choose verbs that align with the skills you want to develop or assess.
- Examples: 
  - Students will **describe** the process of photosynthesis or
  - Students will **construct** a diagram illustrating the process of photosynthesis

## Quality, rigor and integrity

*The smartest heads in the world immerse themselves into a research topic for years. In that process, they become the experts – nobody knows more about that topic. 
The boundaries of knowledge have been pushed forward. When the scientist are confident in their findings, they publish them in the best scientific journals, with the highest standards of quality, rigor, and integrity.*

::: {.callout-important}
How much of that literature is true do you think?

**Instructor Notes**: Add.

## Why should we trust researchers?

::: {.notes}
**Speaker notes**: Add script for the slide here. 
**Instructor Notes**: <br>
- **Aim**: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic.
- For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, students should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break).
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).
- Use multiple slides for this part.
