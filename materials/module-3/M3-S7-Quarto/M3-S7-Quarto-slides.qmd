Questions from previous submodule

-   **Aim**: This first slide is dedicated to clarifying questions from the previous submodule and/or to discuss assignments.
-   Additional slides may need to be added depending on the nature of the homework assignments.
-   Critical for the learning process to ensure that students are on the same page and have been able to achieve the learning goals of the previous workshop.
-   Not applicable if this set of slides corresponds to the first submodule of a new module.

:::

## Before we start: Survey time!

Take this survey to test your prior Quarto knowledge

<a href="https://www.menti.com/al367833ss3g" target="_blank">Quarto Survey link</a>

::: notes

-   **Aim**: The pre-submodule survey serves to examine students' prior knowledge about the sumodule's topic.
-   Use free survey software such as or other survey software (Menti, particify, formR) to establish this. You can use the example survey, edit it or create your own!

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion of survey results

::: notes

-   **Aim**: Briefly examine the answers given to each question interactively with the group.
-   Use visuals from the survey to highlight specific answers.

Make it clear to the group that there will be a similar post-submodule survey to examine understanding and learning progress.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where are we at?

- **Aim**: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.
- Remind students what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is.

---

### Quarto

Quarto makes it easy to analyze, share and reproduce.
It’s a powerful tool for producing transparent, reproducible, and accessible work that can be freely shared, viewed, and reused by others.

::: notes

-   **Aim**: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.
-   Remind students what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is.

:::
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quarto Learning Goals

-   Participants will **learn** how to create, edit, and render Quarto documents
-   Participants will **understand** how to use key Quarto features (code chunks, YAML headers, citations, and output formatting)
-   Participants will **gain confidence** in preparing and teaching Quarto effectively to students

::: notes

-   **Aim**: Formulate specific, action-oriented goals learning goals which are measurable and observable in line with Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956)

-   Place an emphasis on the **verbs** of the learning goals and choose verbs that align with the skills you want to develop or assess.

-   Examples:

    -   Students will **describe** the process of photosynthesis or
    -   Students will **construct** a diagram illustrating the process of photosynthesis

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Terms and Definitions

-   **What is Quarto?** An open-source scientific and publishing system that combines text, code and media to create easily shareable documents such as websites, slides, reports, and much more.

-   **What is Rendering?** The process where Quarto runs the code, combines it with the text, and creates a final output.

-   A Quarto Markdown document is saved as a **.qmd file**

::: notes
Aim: Introduce key terms and definitions that students will come across throughout the session.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Components of a .qmd file

-   **YAML header**- the section at the top of the Quarto document that controls settings like the title, output format, and author.

-   **code chunks**- sections of the document that contains code (from R or Python, for example) that are used for showing results such as tables, plots, or calculations

-   **Quarto Markdown**- combines text, codes, and formatting to create the actual content of the document

---

### Components of a .qmd file

- You can write Quarto documents in **Visual mode** or **Source mode** in RStudio.
- This is part of the **authoring process**, and it allows you to format the text, add code, and build your document using either buttons (WYSIWYM-style) or markdown syntax.

::: notes
Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine exisiting concepts in relation to some key terms.
Re-examine formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Covered in this Session

- Setting up a Quarto Document
- Authoring
- Code Chunks
- Adding Citations
- Publishing

::: notes

Introduction of submodule topic
-   **Aim**: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic.
-   Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).
-   Use multiple slides for this part.

For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, students should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break).

Practical exercises on topic
-   **Aim**: Design practical exercises for students to apply the new skills in practise.
-   Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with the learning objective(s).
-   It's useful to have exercises directly after a topic is taught to reinforce what was learnt.

For students who advance faster: Prepare extra exercises.

-   The default format is html
-   The output format can also be changed by editing the YAML header

#### Task 1

-   [ ] Follow the steps to create a new Quarto Document

:::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rendering

There are two ways to render in Quarto

-   **Manual rendering**: having to click on the "Render" each time you want to see the output
-   **Render on Save**: Quarto will automatically re-render the document each time you click "Save"

### Where are these rendering options in RStudio?

![You can find both Manual Render and Render on Save at the top of your workspace](images/rendering.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authoring

This is the process of writing and structuring the Quarto document.

**YAML Header + Markdown = Authoring**

To practice authoring in Quarto, let's start with setting the YAML header and adding text in **Source** mode.

---

## Authoring

#### Task 2

-   [ ] copy & paste this into the YAML header of your document

``` yaml
---
title: "ChickWeight Analysis"
author: "Your Name"
format:
  html:
    code-fold: false
    toc: true
---
```
::: callout-note
## output format

You can replace "html" to render the document to a different format.

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html" target="_blank">link to a list of the different output formats</a>.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Markdown Text

### Basic Text Formatting

-   **Bold:** `**bold**` → **bold**

-   *Italic:* `*italic*` → *italic*

-   ~~Strikethrough:~~ `~~text~~` → ~~text~~

-   `Inline code:` `` `code` `` → `code`

::: callout-note
## markdown shortcuts

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/options.html">link for the full list of markdown shortcuts</a> for formatting!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Formatting Markdown Text

``` markdown
Have you ever been curious about what affects a chick's weight? 
This document explores the ChickWeight dataset using R.  
The goal is to compare chick weight across different diets and time points.  
Key steps include:

- Loading the dataset  
- Visualizing growth trends  
- Summarizing results
```

#### Task 3

-   [ ] Copy this text and paste it to your document
-   [ ] Bold the word *"ChickWeight"*
-   [ ] Italicize the phrase *"growth trends"*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Adding a Callout Box

Highlight particularly important aspects with Quarto callout boxes, for example:

::: callout-important
## Important with Title

This is an example of a callout box to highlight particularly important information using `callout-important`
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout box to give important tips using `callout-tip`
:::

::: callout-note
## Note with Title

This is an example of a callout box to include an additional note using `callout-note`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Adding a Callout Box

Here is the markdown text for inserting a callout note box.

``` markdown
::: callout-note
## Based on Real Data

The ChickWeight dataset in R is based on real experimental data.
:::
```

<br>

#### Task 4

-   [ ] Copy & paste into your Quarto document to add this callout note box.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Chunks

### Inserting Code

Two ways to insert code chunks:

-   Manually type 3 back ticks \`\`\` then {r} to start a coding chunk and end it with 3 back ticks

**OR**

-   Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac) to insert a code chunk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Inserting Code

``` markdown
summary(ChickWeight)
```

<br>

``` markdown
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = Diet)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick)) +
  labs(title = "Chick Growth Over Time")
```

<br>

#### Task 5

-   [ ] Insert the code in **two separate code chunks**
-   [ ] Render the output and see what you get

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Chunks

Adjust how the code is portrayed by editing the YAML header

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 1;"}

![](images/exercise1.png)
:::

::: {style="flex: 1;"}

-   `code-fold: false` - the code is visible and not collapsible (as seen here)
-   `code-fold: true` - collapses the code so the reader can expand it

:::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Code Chunks

Adjust how the code is portrayed by editing the YAML header

:::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: {style="flex: 1;"}

![](images/exercise1.png)
:::

::: {style="flex: 1;"}

-   `code-tools: true` - adds the functions "show code" at the top of the page and "copy" next to the chunks
-   `echo: true` - both the code and the output is visible

:::
::::::

---

## Code Chunks

Let's edit the YAML header to make the code chunks collapsible and add code tools.

#### Task 6

-   [ ] change `code-fold: false` to `code-fold: true`
-   [ ] add `code-tools: true`
-   [ ] render the document to see the changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pre-break survey

::: notes
-   **Aim**: This pre-break survey serves to examine students' current understanding of key concepts of the submodule
-   Use free survey software such as or other survey software (Menti, particify, formR) to establish the following questions (shown on separate slides).

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's the name of Quarto Markdown document**?

a.  .png file

b.  .qmd file ✅

c.  .doc file

d.  .mp3 file

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [ ] Copy & paste the markdown text to insert an image with a caption (edit path if needed)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Creating Columns

You can change the layout of a section using columns.

-  Start the column layout by writing ":::::: columns"
-  Begin the first column with "::: column"
-  Add content and end it with ":::"
-  Begin second coloumn with "::: column"
-  Add content and end it with ":::"
-  End section with a final "::::::"

::: callout-note
## list of page layout options

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html">link for page layout options</a> to author how content looks on your document!

```

-   [ ] Copy & paste the markdown text to add an image with bullet points using columns (edit path if needed)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding Citations with Zotero

-   **Zotero** is a free reference management tool to collect, organize, cite, and share research sources.
-   You can use **Zotero** in RStudio to easily insert citations into your Quarto document

## Adding Citations with Zotero

![](images/zotero1.png)

To insert a citation:

-   Switch to the "Visual Editor" mode

-   In the YAML header, add `bibliography: references.bib`

-   Press the "Insert" button in the toolbar and select "Citation"

---

## Adding Citations with Zotero

:::::: columns
::: column

![](images/zotero2.png)
:::
::: column

- You can select citations straight from your library and folders in Zotero

- Each citation is assigned a short citation key based on the author and year (e.g., Zimmerman2002).

- You can quickly cite it in your document by typing @ followed by the citation key.

:::
::::::

## Publishing

What is **Publishing** with Quarto? It's the process of sharing the rendered documents or projects online so it can become accessible to others.

You can publish to:

- GitHub Pages
- Quarto Pub
- personal website

::: callout-note
## list of publishing services

Here is a <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/index.html">link for a list of publishing services</a> and more information!
:::

---

## Publishing to GitHub

A great option to share your document is publishing to GitHub.

- **GitHub** is a platform for hosting and sharing code and projects online

- An advantage of GitHub is it allows for **version control**- the ability to track and manage changes over time

- One of the ways Quarto can publish your document to GitHub is by using **GitHub Pages**

---

## Publishing to GitHub

**GitHub Pages** enables you to publish content based on source code managed within a GitHub repository.

3 ways to publish a Quarto document to GitHub Pages:

- Render to the `docs` directory and checking it into your repository
- Use the `quarto publish` command 
- Use GitHub Actions to auto-render and publish whenever you push changes

Let's take a closer look at the first method: **Render to `docs`**

---

## Publishing to GitHub

### Render to `docs`

- Edit the YAML header and add `output-dir: docs` at the end
- In the root of your GitHub repo, create an empty file named `.nojekyll` by running the following in the terminal for Mac/Linux:

```markdown
touch .nojekyll
```
OR the following for Windows command prompt:

```markdown
copy NUL .nojekyll
```
---

## Publishing to GitHub

### Render to `docs`

- Enter the following in the Terminal to render and push your site to GitHub 

```markdown
quarto render
git add docs
git commit -m "Publish site to docs/"
git push
```
---

## Publishing to GitHub

#### Task 10
